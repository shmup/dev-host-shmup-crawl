16:21 < zackoid> shmup: are you making a graph of the worst addicted players
16:26 <@shmup> lol
16:26 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/ghost-of-the-week.txt
16:27 <@shmup> but i'm trying to filter out bots, is the thing. i keep a list and only have 2 in it. there is no good query at the moment. was talking in dev about it.
16:28 <@shmup> i'm also working on a thing for http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/
16:28 < zackoid> that is not a public directory
16:28 <@shmup> octo / log
16:29 <@shmup> i'm gonna add an input up top for regex filtering. will not output any of our log here by default.
16:29 <@shmup> i started fresh so no previous history in log
16:29 < zackoid> i mean i just get a login prompt
16:29 <@shmup> yes, u: octo p: log
16:30 <@shmup> it's nothing atm. pointless to link really
16:30 < zackoid> oh
16:31 <@shmup> i can always grep my own log but earlier when you forgot the git command, i wish i had a frontend to quickly regex/grep shit out
16:31 <@shmup> from here
16:41 < zackoid> what, you don't log all of our wonderful banter for posterity?
16:48 <@shmup> haha
16:48 <@shmup> well by principle i log everything irc related :P
16:49 <@shmup> this is just a new special log, located elsewhere with permissions to read, ignoring things like nick changes etc

21:20 <@shmup> zackoid: thoughts on http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/dev.php?search=git
21:21 <@shmup> i could make it so that i dont wrap the query in .* 
21:21 <@shmup> or i could leave it raw and just let the user do what is needed
21:21 <@shmup> aka they would need to .* around things, otherwise the pattern matching just returns the single pattern found in each line. not the whole line. . or i could revise that i guess
21:22 <@shmup> i could also give options to check like "dont search nicks"
21:31 < odiv> zackoid: Yeah, I just meant like what does your question mean?
21:31 < odiv> Obv you figured it out. :P

21:39 < zackoid> odiv: i ended up clearing them.  i just don't know how you survive if you don't.
21:42 < zackoid> shmup: so just a searchable log?  i don't see where the git happens
21:43 < odiv> Oh, you fuckin' book it. :P
21:44 < odiv> or you play tele roulette
21:44 < odiv> I should play again. I miss it.
21:51 < zackoid> but everything's gonna cut you off at the choke point
21:51 < zackoid> and tele is really dangerous since you have like a 40% chance of landing in the uncleared part

23:14 <@shmup> oh zackoid no i just wanted to grep _this chan_ and i could look at previous commands you've done, etc
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: tell me the diff bot searching abilities sometime
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: i made another page to just grep git and list links to the raw source files (loads faster) but i'm not sure what all the search features are in botland
23:53 <@shmup> like you can search commit names? last commits? etc
23:56 < zackoid> i don't know that bot very well since i don't even know what it's called and don't know if there are any docs
23:56 < zackoid> one downside to having octotrog relay everything
23:57 < zackoid> there was a dblist entry that had basic help on all the bot operators but now i don't even remember what that was

00:04 < zackoid> ?!spen
00:04 < OCTOTROG> {SPEN}: <zackoid>	you sleep anything that you can sleep, you confuse anything you can confuse, you tukima anything with a weapon that you can tukima, you blind anything you can blind, you go invis against anything without sinv, in that order
00:04 < zackoid> i'm sure i was verbing tukima as a joke but it still hurts to read.
00:05 < zackoid> also i'd revise that because invis doesn't really go at the end, it depends.  invis has a lot of defensive benefits.
00:20 <@shmup> verbing things is nice all the time
00:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?search=slow
00:20 <@shmup> i can improve big time but if you have a thought let me know.. won't except patterns atm lol
00:22 <@shmup> things that are bad about linking to raw is line numbers are less useful :P i think i'll include regular link and [raw] after it
00:23 <@shmup> johnstein only once said "by johnstein"
00:23 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?grep=johnstein
00:42 < johnstein> shmup: authentication required
03:23 < Rotatell> johnstein: Unstable branch on crawl.beRotato.org updated to: 0.19-a0-1068-g99dd0f4 (34)
08:53 <@shmup> johnstein: octo/log
08:59 < advil> maybe useful to restrict to just the main source directory
09:00 < advil> to have an option that does that I mean
09:01 < advil> e.g. if you search for "hellion" there's a ton of misc results that you may or may not want, but the key link w.r.t. the source is just mon-data.h
09:03 <@shmup> that's fair, you mean the crawl-ref/source dir right?
09:03 < advil> yeah
09:03 < advil> or I suppose another way to do it would be by file type
09:04 < advil> .h vs .c vs .des vs misc or something
09:04 < advil> since you often do want to exclude .h from a grep
09:05 <@shmup> hm. def more thought needed.
09:05 <@shmup> also how i'm parsing results is kinda fucked. grep returns information separated by : and i'm being lazy and splitting on : atm.
09:06 <@shmup> however if the result actually contains a :, i'm gonna be doing things _wrong_
09:06 < advil>  haha that explains what's going on with the .des results then
09:06 <@shmup> yeah haha
09:06 <@shmup> exactly
09:06 <@shmup> this was a 12a thing i started and shouldn't have (cause 12a)
09:07 < advil> also uh stupid-ish question, have you played with github's code search?
09:07 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=hellion
09:07 <@shmup> i also think it might be best to just let you use raw regex, however having to do .*foo.* all the time (99% of the time) could be annoying. maybe i could compensnate somehow.
09:07 < advil> not that doing your own thing is bad or anything
09:08 <@shmup> yeah really i use that and just grepping locally
09:08 <@shmup> but .. a few of my browsers for whatever reason, choke on github cause it loads the fancy result page w/ line nums and shit.
09:08 <@shmup> i cant explain why it loads so poorly for me if a large file
09:08 <@shmup> so i always prefer to see the raw result
09:09 <@shmup> honestly man, i dont even know why i did the git thing. i just wanted an irc log search lol
09:09 < advil> heh
09:09 <@shmup> then zackoid, very late, made a comment about "not seeing the git thing" and
09:09 <@shmup> unsure exactly what he wanted.. i started a thing
09:09 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/?search=%21lg
09:10 <@shmup> i just wanna do that sometimes to remind myself of syntax
09:10 <@shmup> i Learn By Example (or never learn cause i rely on examples all the time)
09:10 < advil> hmm
09:11 < advil> we should put the lg docs in the topic
09:11 < advil> I can't set it myself though
09:11 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/docs/listgame.md
09:12 < advil> I do actually sometimes search the logs in crawl-dev for bot syntax too
09:17 < zackoid> shmup: i just meant the button said something about git on it, so i wasn't sure what i was looking at.  our i was hallucinating becuase i was tired.
09:58 < zackoid> advil: getting a lil' salty on the tavern huh
10:03 < advil> haha yes
10:03 < advil> it'll get ignored though probably
10:03 < advil> tavern is such a dysfunctional community
10:04 < advil> I get more and more fed up with it as time goes on

10:05 <@advil> hi :)
10:05 <@shmup> it did not say git on the button zackoid! lol
10:06 <@zackoid> advil: i agree and i stopped reading it for a long time.  but i think that particularly comment was just a n00b.
10:06 <@shmup> link?
10:06 <@shmup> to the advil-thread
10:06 <@advil> oh my saltiness is just a side-comment on a thread that was already split from something else
10:06 <@advil> zackoid: nago isn't a noob
10:06 <@advil> he used to be a blue name even
10:07 <@zackoid> ah i was referring to the guy who mentioned orb guardians to begin with
10:07 <@advil> lethediver is sort of maybe, if that's who you mean
10:07 <@advil> I kind of suspect lethediver is a sock
10:07 <@zackoid> i logged into the tavern for the first time ever yesterday, and almost posted a comment.  WHY THE HELL is the unread-thread text bolded, eye-searing bright red?
10:08 <@zackoid> heh you think that of everyone.
10:08 <@advil> well there's a continuous stream of semi-trolling noobs with weird strong opinions
10:08 <@advil> I guess crawl could just breed those
10:08 <@shmup> it is a nice looking phpBB forum
10:09 <@shmup> i never visit here, really. very very seldomly
10:09 <@advil> shmup https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=20967
10:10 <@advil> anyways that attitude about sequell is all over tavern, it annoys me
10:11 <@shmup> really? ha
10:11 <@shmup> > Where are the bot-queries-always-have-the-right-answers guys when they are really needed?
10:11 <@shmup> you are referring to that right?
10:11 <@zackoid> well it's true that just posting queries has a very low signal
10:11 <@advil> yeah
10:12 <@advil> it's true that there've been a few people who tended to use sequell queries incompetently in arguments and wouldn't stop
10:12 <@advil> bcadren was on iirc
10:12 <@zackoid> but by now people should be able to intuit what the data is actually saying, because the bias is the same one in most cases
10:12 <@advil> yeah
10:13 <@advil> some day I'm gonna import sequell data into some of the more sophisticated models we use in research
10:13 <@advil> it's not even as if the biases in the data can't be dealt with
10:14 <@zackoid> is there anything as powerful as player skill in the data you work with (that is not directly correlated with something easy to identify)?
10:14 <@shmup> that would be v interesting, advil 
10:16 <@advil> zackoid: probably not, but player skill should be correlated with a ton of easy things
10:16 <@advil> # games, # wins, for two
10:16 <@shmup> yeah
10:16 <@zackoid> it is DEFINITELY not correlated with games, heh
10:16 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained within wins
10:16 <@advil> and there is a lot of stuff around modeling variation between subjects
10:17 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained when obtaining runes (w/o win) in general
10:17 <@advil> I'm sure it correlates with # games, if you factor in individual differences
10:17 <@advil> there are very few people who could play hundreds of games without getting better in some way
10:18 <@zackoid> the guy who won shmup ghostkill award had 2000 in 3 months without winning.
10:18 <@zackoid> turns would be better, probably.
10:18 <@zackoid> maybe hours.
10:18 <@advil> well, but correlation has no commitment to there not being outliers
10:19 <@zackoid> yeah though i don't think that was really an extreme outlier.  bad players rack up games because they end so fast.
10:19 <@advil> and I would be surprised if even that guy didn't have some measurable improvement over those 2000 games
10:19 <@advil> just not improvement that involves winning
10:19 <@zackoid> and also most people, after they first win, get worse before they get better again i think.
10:19 <@advil> probably "skill" is fairly high dimensional
10:21 <@shmup> that person was likely a bot, also
10:21 <@advil> but I think you are thinking in too categorical terms :)
10:21 <@shmup> i kinda wish bots were allowed by required tagging in crawlrc heh
10:21 <@zackoid> i don't think that was a bot.
10:21 <@advil> I'm 95% sure that if you plotted # games and # wins, there'd be a clear linear correlation (even if that's not the best way to model it)
10:22 <@zackoid> well games vs wins would.  or do you mean skill vs games and wins
10:22 <@advil> well, I'm not sure that skill makes sense as a single dimensional-value
10:22 <@advil> but wins is a proxy for skill, presumably
10:22 <@zackoid> probably not.  i just meant that you can't win without playing another game
10:23 <@shmup> man
10:23 <@shmup> deep learning on some data would be fun

11:19 <@zackoid> well, 1.
11:23 <@zackoid> fortunately i looked at that before going into a half-hour diversion of looking up lava orc nutrition mechanics
16:50 <@zackoid> advil: R1 faculty sure are inbred huh
16:51 <@advil> probably
16:51 <@advil> it's worst at the top schools
16:51 <@advil> it's more like the top 10 in any given field are inbred
16:52 <@zackoid> i'm looking over where our faculty got their phds and it's the same handful of schools over and over.
16:52 <@zackoid> plus one santa cruz linguist, so i guess their linguistics department is better than the average there.
16:52 <@advil> yeah it's very godo
16:52 <@advil> *good
16:52 <@advil> (that's where I went)
16:53 <@zackoid> i saw a paper a few months ago that was using a network model for this and it verified that nobody hires from schools 'beneath' them, so at the top you can only hire for like 5 schools.
16:53 <@advil> probably the three ling departments with the best placement are MIT, UCSC, UMass Amherst
16:53 <@advil> maybe Stanford
16:53 <@advil> you've got all four I think?
16:54 <@zackoid> do we even have 4 linguistics faculty
16:54 <@advil> oh maybe no MIT
16:54 <@advil> 3 umass, one stanford, one (retired) UCSC
16:55 <@zackoid> uh shit i hope she retired in the last couple months
16:55 <@advil> I don't think so but I don't know the exact dates
16:56 <@zackoid> well shit.
16:56 <@zackoid> this should only be active faculty.
16:56 <@advil> she still has an appointment as a research associate
16:56 <@advil> http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/associates/gunlogson_christine/index.html
16:57 <@zackoid> ok, that's likely, this pool is all research + teaching staff.
17:00 <@zackoid> advil: since you were a product, is umass-boston a big thing or is the system just overwriting all umass schools with the first on the list
17:00 <@advil> umass boston is not a big thing
17:00 <@advil> "UMass" means UMass Amherst
17:01 <@advil> UMass Boston / UMass Lowell are ok local schools, lots of commuters / returning students, I think they might be R2s?
17:01 <@zackoid> i was suspicious because while i've heard of lowell i've never even heard of boston
17:01 <@advil> it's very unlikely that anyone who works at rochester has a Ph.D from UMass Boston
17:01 <@advil> (and no one in ling does)
17:01 <@zackoid> and a lot of the schools have really dumb names so i'm guessing some software is fucking it up
17:02 <@advil> I know someone who taught there through tenure and it was a shitty job
17:02 <@zackoid> heh one of them is a linguist
17:02 <@zackoid> and her CV says amherst.  bleh.
17:03 <@zackoid> actually 2/5 are linguists.  one more thing on the pile of corrections.
17:03 <@advil> haha good thing you know me!
17:04 <@zackoid> i did suspect something fishy but it's possible i would have been too drained of this crap to look it up if you hadn't provided an easy resource.
17:04 <@zackoid> so thanks.
17:05 <@advil> maybe this is why the dean's office always makes us give this stuff to them in like 3 different formats
17:07 <@advil> I think at least 3 people in your ling dept have degrees from UMass

17:20 <@zackoid> advil: is there any effort to make faculty have like perfectly standardized CV formats?
17:20 <@advil> haha no
17:20 <@advil> there's always some semi-standardized word template that they want us to use to convey the same information in addition to the CV though
17:21 <@advil> part if the issue is that bib standards vary by field

17:58 <@advil> well, I spent most of the afternoon doing bs administrative stuff too
17:58 <@advil> just from a desk in ottawa :-P
18:03 <@zackoid> are you writing up there?  you can't possibly have actual vacation time
18:03 <@advil> well, if you mean vacation time in a technical sense, keep in mind that most academics are on a 9 month salary
18:04 <@zackoid> yeah, but you're expected to fund yourself doing more work through the summer, no?
18:04 <@advil> so I'm not really even being paid for the summer (though I get my 9-month salary distributed through 12 months, also common)
18:04 <@advil> yeah, that is the culture
18:05 <@advil> I did take a real 10 day vacation in june, to Paris ;-)
18:07 <@zackoid> the first and last until you make tenure?
18:07 <@advil> there's not an expectation per se that I augment up to 12 months, but there is also the expectation that I don't sit around playing stardew valley all summer

19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[4/5]: Finally, stab damage gets an additional bonus multiplier of (12 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / {stab bonus}) / 12 for all weapons.
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[5
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[5/5]: (lower is better): sleeping/paralysed = 1, netted/webbed/petrifying/petrified = 2, invisible/confused/fleeing/ally = 4, distracted = 6
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[1
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[1/5]: A stab with a short blade does increased damage: (dam+bonus)*mult, where bonus depends on your dex as well as your stealth and weapon skills and is capped at 30, and mult depends on your stealth/weapon skills and the type of stab (sleep/paralysis is best). Non-short blades don't get a bonus and have lower mult. Daggers get bonus doubled (but still capped at 30).
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[3
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[3/5]: For short/long blades and one-handed polearms, stab damage gets a bonus multiplier of (10 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / ({stab bonus} + 2 (if using a long blade or one-handed polearm))) / 10

12:28 <@shmup> but i didnt check my race abilities
12:29 <@shmup> ???naga
12:29 < OCTOTROG> The player race has sInv, rPois, a poisonous spit attack, +5 stealth apt and natural stealth boosts, plus xl/3 natural AC. In return, they have a penalty to movement speed, receive halved base AC for body armours, and cannot wear boots (though bardings have 4 base AC). Nagas gain constriction at xl13. / Universally slow-moving (but normal attack speed); {Naga mage}s and {Greater Naga}
12:29 < OCTOTROG> use haste and conjurations to deal with this. All naga also have constriction. Basic {naga} are weak, while {Naga Warriors} are bulky and hit hard. A {Salamander} is essentially fire-themed Naga. Also see: {Naga Ritualist} {Salamander Firebrand} {Salamander Stormcaller} {Naga Sharpshooter}
12:38 <@zackoid> they can spit poison yeah
12:38 <@zackoid> and you really need to abuse it to survive
12:38 <@zackoid> they're strong eventually but one of the worst starting races because you can't run from anything

10:01 <@shmup> you can really really really start out unluckily as a caster
10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a rat on D:1, with 4 points after 46 turns and 0:01:06. [cbro+]
10:02 <@shmup> lol

10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a giant gecko on D:1, with 2 points after 44 turns and 0:00:34. [cbro+]
10:02 <@zackoid> it's not so much unlucky as you're lucky when you're not killed by the first think you meet.
10:03 <@zackoid> giant gecko is probably the wost possible first monster now.
10:03 <@zackoid> rats or bats are the best.
10:04 <@shmup> yeah, fair. lucky wasn't even what i was feeling
10:05 <@shmup> well in rat scenario it was starting and i could situate myself so only 1 thing could get me.
10:05 <@shmup> but it was.. 5 rats? 1 kobold? then a final rat? or something.
10:05 <@zackoid> yah that's pretty bad.
10:05 < OCTOTROG> shmup (L1 HOFE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
10:05 <@zackoid> if there's something you can do about that i don't know what it is.
10:06 <@shmup> my best chance so far was when i found a spear instantly. then an enchanted dagger i should not have equipped ;)
10:07 <@advil> for a caster start a first priority is to find somewhere where you can pillar dance
10:07 <@zackoid> now that monster-generated weapons are identified i never pick up anything blue off the ground until i have a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> i heard someone else say that recently but i don't get it
10:08 <@shmup> why not hold in inventory?
10:08 <@shmup> it's not like you're gonna hit max inv by time you get a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> well, unlikely
10:09 <@zackoid> i think the early generation is biased toward cursed stuff but i don't know that
10:09 <@zackoid> and 95% of the time by the time i would want any of that i have a decent weapon anyway
10:45 < necKro> we could just add a .. that works like !!
10:45 < necKro> or something
10:46 <@zackoid> are there any . commands that are useful?
10:49 <@advil> I'm not sure what "." means conventionally as opposed to "!"
10:49 <@advil> but some of them could be useful I guess
10:50 <@advil> that is, they don't seem any less useful than the ! ones, just sometimes a bit more special purpose
10:50 <@advil> lots of ones that trigger specific tvs, or find specific kinds of killers, or deaths on particular maps
10:50 <@advil> like johnstein has .hsmap
10:50 <@advil> er
10:50 <@advil> .jsmap
10:51 <@advil> it's the = ones that aren't very useful on their own
11:34 <@shmup> scroll through the list, zackoid .

12:25 <@shmup> you think vehemut, zackoid?
12:27 <@zackoid> depends if you want to hit things with axes or blast
12:30 <@shmup> i only picked up the damn axe cause i thought i wanted a weapon
12:31 <@shmup> i wanna blast. but i did put 6 points in my axe
12:31 <@shmup> which obv it'd need more. shit
12:31 <@shmup> what would you go with if you wanted to axe but still blast a bit. some armour/weapon god? 
12:33 <@zackoid> i usually use ash for that case, but ash is kinda tough if you're not used to blasters 'cause xhe doesn't provide a lot of help early on.  i think vehumet is the easiest way to learn the conj playstyle.
12:33 <@zackoid> axes are just XP hungry relative to other weapons, though the apt might balance that out i'm not sure

10:24 <@zackoid> pfft not even a full-health 1-shot
10:24 <@zackoid> did you drag that up from d:3
10:24 <@zackoid> ?
10:27 <@shmup> yeah. i left it behind and then chose the wrong stairs later.
10:28 <@zackoid> one of the dumbest lessons that took me too long to learn was not to go (immediately) back down the same stairs you just narrowly escaped via
10:28 <@zackoid> also to use X-e
10:28 <@shmup> that's not what happened but that is a good lesson
10:29 <@shmup> i just happened to go back to the same stairs after doing other things
10:29 <@zackoid> yeah i know what you meant, what i'm talking about is much dumber
10:29 <@zackoid> but it is a good idea to drop exclusions for that reason
10:29 <@shmup> ahh. X-e though? sec
10:29 <@shmup> oh i should do that ^
10:30 <@shmup> i def 10000% wanna start doing that actually

10:30 <@shmup> yes..
10:30 <@shmup> damn.
10:44 <@advil> it's a very good idea, especially on a non noisy char
10:45 <@advil> I find that in lair I set 1-4 exclusions per level routinely
10:51 <@zackoid> and then you auto-travel to the edge of your exclusion and wake up a different monster that wakes up the one you excluded.

13:07 <@zackoid> ??energy randomization
13:07 < OCTOTROG> energy randomisation[1/3]: Every time a monster makes a movement (i.e. not an attack/spell), the amount of time taken to do its turn has a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns slower, a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns quicker and a 1/3 chance of being the normal amount. Over time, these 0.1s add up or cancel out to cause 'double moves' or 'lost moves'.
13:07 <@shmup> okay so i went for it on purpose tho cause i was a bit stealthy
13:07 <@shmup> and got up on it and got it to yellow but then

13:08 <@shmup> i was just commenting on speed
13:08 <@zackoid> i think you want to learn conj flame before sticky probs
13:08 <@zackoid> conj flame is really good and much easier to cast
13:09 <@zackoid> also totally forget about stabs
13:09 <@zackoid> try to kill everything at the edge of LoS
13:09 <@zackoid> stab power depends on having stealth and shortblade skill
13:09 <@zackoid> also if an ogre is asleep on D:3 let it sleep.
13:10 <@shmup> oh, all right
13:10 <@shmup> yeah i havent tried conj once yet
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[1/2]: A level 3 spell that creates a cloud of flame in the selected unoccupied space. Many weaker monsters will be unwilling to cross it, but some tougher or less intelligent ones will.
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame[2
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[2/2]: Usage: Fight in corridors. Lure things into corridors. Conjure flame in front of them.
13:10 <@zackoid> the unoccupied place is the most important thing to remember, you have to use it before the monster gets to you
13:10 <@zackoid> but it lets you seal off halways from weak things and blast at your leisure
13:10 <@zackoid> strong things and dumb things will walk right through it, but it does good damage especially if you can trap them in it or chain them
13:24 <@shmup> i don't wanna ever exist in a world where a high elf can't outrun an ogre btw

Always has a cloak. Random colour. Like an ogre, he can deal up to 35 or so damage in one shot. Or paralyse or banish you.

09:43 <@shmup> i'm still uncertain about conjure flame
09:43 <@shmup> i've only tried it a bit, but even an adder won't walk in the damn thing.
09:43 <@advil> uncertain?
09:43 <@shmup> like, not familiar with it
09:43 <@advil> ah
09:43 <@shmup> not sure how dumb is dumb re: mob brains
09:43 <@advil> it's very, very good
09:43 <@zackoid> adder not walking into it is good
09:43 <@shmup> fair
09:44 <@zackoid> only really dumb weak things will walk into it
09:44 <@shmup> so you use it to gain distance AND maybe deal damage if they're super dumb
09:44 <@zackoid> really dumb means mostly zombocoms and skeletons
09:44 <@advil> whether something with brains will walk into it depends on hp, so it's hard to predict
09:44 <@shmup> okay yeah no that does change my viewpoint re distance
09:44 <@zackoid> STRONG things will just not gaf
09:44 <@advil> insects too?
09:44 <@zackoid> though it depends on how much HP they have at the time

09:45 <@advil> maybe not any more
09:45 <@zackoid> ??monster intelligence
09:45 < OCTOTROG> monster intelligence[1/12]: From worst to best: Brainless, Animal, Human. This has many effects on monster behaviour, most notably pursuing you longer, pathfinding better, being more wary of traps/clouds and moving in ways that inconviences you more.
09:45 <@zackoid> there used to be more, right?
09:45 <@advil> yeah
09:46 <@advil> flame cloud is reliable for damaging heavy things, uniques, hydras, that sort of monster
09:46 <@advil> otherwise you use it to trap something while you shoot it or poke at it with a polearm
09:48 <@advil> oh the other thing is that if something's already in a cloud, it will freely walk to more clouds
09:48 <@advil> situationally useful to know
09:49 <@shmup> trying to figure out X-e more.
09:49 <@shmup> by default it fills all rooms visible red, autotravel excluded? but i can press again to just mark single ones (white) and.. those are excluded.. but surrounding is all red still?
09:49 <@zackoid> the 'in another cloud' part is more important with freezing cloud since you can drop that on top of monsters
09:50 <@shmup> i just wanna say "this stair is excluded"
09:50 <@shmup> "stop me if i'm gonna try going up it"
09:50 <@shmup> "or tell me rather"
09:50 <@zackoid> once is LOS from the spot, twice is the spot itself, thrice is clear
09:50 <@shmup> okay well that's what i don't like ^
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a regular spot it changes color
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a stair it does not
09:50 <@shmup> re: spot itself/twice
09:50 <@zackoid> #consoleproblems
09:50 <@shmup> lol
09:51 <@advil> I think technically when you set it on a stair the exclusion is on the other floor
09:51 <@advil> so it'll show there
09:51 <@zackoid> on tiles it works normally
09:51 <@shmup> ty it worked. 
09:51 <@shmup> i mean it yelled at me when trying to go up

09:53 <@zackoid> johnstein: this is wrong, right?
09:53 <@zackoid> https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=21032
09:54 <@zackoid> i've used wizmode on dbro but i thought that was disabled for most people.
09:56 < johnstein> both cbro and dbro compile for wizmode
09:56 < johnstein> on cbro there's dgamelaunch Magic to check if you are a glad
09:56 < johnstein> uh
09:56 < johnstein> if you are a dgladmin
09:57 < johnstein> ie on the admin list. only devs and the occasional other server admin's are on the list and it's a manual process
09:57 < johnstein> so gammafunk can play wizmode on cbro
09:57 < johnstein> and everyone can play wizmode on dbro
09:58 < johnstein> and I'm not sure about the load concern. but I remember someone (some dev?) said there are mild security concerns
09:58 < johnstein> but no one elaborated when I asked for specifics. probably with mildly good reason
09:58 < johnstein> ie not discussing them openly in a chat room with a public searchable log
09:59 < johnstein> I should reply in that thread.  but ugh, Tavern
10:01 <@zackoid> i just thought it odd that a non-admin would talk about using wizmode on CBRO
10:01 < johnstein> oh did I read it wrong?
10:01 < johnstein> he says 8081
10:01 < johnstein> that's dbro
10:01 <@zackoid> ah.
10:01 <@zackoid> i always used dev.
10:02 < johnstein> my snarky reply is, "I can't Believe any lamers aren't using the dev.berotato.org address for dbro"
10:02 <@zackoid> they better not blow up my secret wizmode spot.

13:34 <@zackoid> ah the old double shaft
13:44 <@zackoid> i wonder how hard it would be to have a bot command that fetched the skills, stats, slot a and slot b items from a current dump, launch a crawl instance, fsim weapon a and b, and dump the results back.  everything except returning the results could be done with command line scripting and internal lua i think, though it'd be pretty hacky
13:45 <@zackoid> how hacky depending on if lua can read from arbitrary files.
13:47 <@zackoid> probably the whole thing could be done with pexpect
14:29 <@shmup> what is fsim, zackoid?

14:31 <@zackoid> wizmode fight simulator.  
14:31 <@zackoid> i most use it to compare weapons
14:31 <@zackoid> mostly
14:39 <@zackoid> why is this in the crawl FAQ under 'easy gods for new players': "The most straightforward gods to play are probably Trog or Okawaru (for melee and ranged combat), Vehumet or Sif Muna (for spellcasting), and Yredelemnul (for undead allies). Also, while unreliable, Xom can be a lot of fun."
14:39 <@zackoid> that is an awful answer.
14:40 <@shmup> haha
14:40 <@shmup> indeed
14:45 <@zackoid> even ignoring the xom part, sif is one of the worst gods for a new player and yred, while strong, involves ally management, one of the most frustrating things in crawl.
14:55 <@shmup> what two spelling casting gods would you recommend
14:56 <@zackoid> for a beginner i would not recommend casting at all, and framing it as casting god vs not is problematic anyway.  but if someone was trying to learn how to play a primary-conjurations character i would say vehumet, because vehumet is very straightforward.
