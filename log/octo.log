16:21 < zackoid> shmup: are you making a graph of the worst addicted players
16:26 <@shmup> lol
16:26 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/ghost-of-the-week.txt
16:27 <@shmup> but i'm trying to filter out bots, is the thing. i keep a list and only have 2 in it. there is no good query at the moment. was talking in dev about it.
16:28 <@shmup> i'm also working on a thing for http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/
16:28 < zackoid> that is not a public directory
16:28 <@shmup> octo / log
16:29 <@shmup> i'm gonna add an input up top for regex filtering. will not output any of our log here by default.
16:29 <@shmup> i started fresh so no previous history in log
16:29 < zackoid> i mean i just get a login prompt
16:29 <@shmup> yes, u: octo p: log
16:30 <@shmup> it's nothing atm. pointless to link really
16:30 < zackoid> oh
16:31 <@shmup> i can always grep my own log but earlier when you forgot the git command, i wish i had a frontend to quickly regex/grep shit out
16:31 <@shmup> from here
16:41 < zackoid> what, you don't log all of our wonderful banter for posterity?
16:48 <@shmup> haha
16:48 <@shmup> well by principle i log everything irc related :P
16:49 <@shmup> this is just a new special log, located elsewhere with permissions to read, ignoring things like nick changes etc

21:20 <@shmup> zackoid: thoughts on http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/dev.php?search=git
21:21 <@shmup> i could make it so that i dont wrap the query in .* 
21:21 <@shmup> or i could leave it raw and just let the user do what is needed
21:21 <@shmup> aka they would need to .* around things, otherwise the pattern matching just returns the single pattern found in each line. not the whole line. . or i could revise that i guess
21:22 <@shmup> i could also give options to check like "dont search nicks"
21:31 < odiv> zackoid: Yeah, I just meant like what does your question mean?
21:31 < odiv> Obv you figured it out. :P

21:39 < zackoid> odiv: i ended up clearing them.  i just don't know how you survive if you don't.
21:42 < zackoid> shmup: so just a searchable log?  i don't see where the git happens
21:43 < odiv> Oh, you fuckin' book it. :P
21:44 < odiv> or you play tele roulette
21:44 < odiv> I should play again. I miss it.
21:51 < zackoid> but everything's gonna cut you off at the choke point
21:51 < zackoid> and tele is really dangerous since you have like a 40% chance of landing in the uncleared part

23:14 <@shmup> oh zackoid no i just wanted to grep _this chan_ and i could look at previous commands you've done, etc
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: tell me the diff bot searching abilities sometime
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: i made another page to just grep git and list links to the raw source files (loads faster) but i'm not sure what all the search features are in botland
23:53 <@shmup> like you can search commit names? last commits? etc
23:56 < zackoid> i don't know that bot very well since i don't even know what it's called and don't know if there are any docs
23:56 < zackoid> one downside to having octotrog relay everything
23:57 < zackoid> there was a dblist entry that had basic help on all the bot operators but now i don't even remember what that was

00:04 < zackoid> ?!spen
00:04 < OCTOTROG> {SPEN}: <zackoid>	you sleep anything that you can sleep, you confuse anything you can confuse, you tukima anything with a weapon that you can tukima, you blind anything you can blind, you go invis against anything without sinv, in that order
00:04 < zackoid> i'm sure i was verbing tukima as a joke but it still hurts to read.
00:05 < zackoid> also i'd revise that because invis doesn't really go at the end, it depends.  invis has a lot of defensive benefits.
00:20 <@shmup> verbing things is nice all the time
00:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?search=slow
00:20 <@shmup> i can improve big time but if you have a thought let me know.. won't except patterns atm lol
00:22 <@shmup> things that are bad about linking to raw is line numbers are less useful :P i think i'll include regular link and [raw] after it
00:23 <@shmup> johnstein only once said "by johnstein"
00:23 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?grep=johnstein
00:42 < johnstein> shmup: authentication required
03:23 < Rotatell> johnstein: Unstable branch on crawl.beRotato.org updated to: 0.19-a0-1068-g99dd0f4 (34)
08:53 <@shmup> johnstein: octo/log
08:59 < advil> maybe useful to restrict to just the main source directory
09:00 < advil> to have an option that does that I mean
09:01 < advil> e.g. if you search for "hellion" there's a ton of misc results that you may or may not want, but the key link w.r.t. the source is just mon-data.h
09:03 <@shmup> that's fair, you mean the crawl-ref/source dir right?
09:03 < advil> yeah
09:03 < advil> or I suppose another way to do it would be by file type
09:04 < advil> .h vs .c vs .des vs misc or something
09:04 < advil> since you often do want to exclude .h from a grep
09:05 <@shmup> hm. def more thought needed.
09:05 <@shmup> also how i'm parsing results is kinda fucked. grep returns information separated by : and i'm being lazy and splitting on : atm.
09:06 <@shmup> however if the result actually contains a :, i'm gonna be doing things _wrong_
09:06 < advil>  haha that explains what's going on with the .des results then
09:06 <@shmup> yeah haha
09:06 <@shmup> exactly
09:06 <@shmup> this was a 12a thing i started and shouldn't have (cause 12a)
09:07 < advil> also uh stupid-ish question, have you played with github's code search?
09:07 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=hellion
09:07 <@shmup> i also think it might be best to just let you use raw regex, however having to do .*foo.* all the time (99% of the time) could be annoying. maybe i could compensnate somehow.
09:07 < advil> not that doing your own thing is bad or anything
09:08 <@shmup> yeah really i use that and just grepping locally
09:08 <@shmup> but .. a few of my browsers for whatever reason, choke on github cause it loads the fancy result page w/ line nums and shit.
09:08 <@shmup> i cant explain why it loads so poorly for me if a large file
09:08 <@shmup> so i always prefer to see the raw result
09:09 <@shmup> honestly man, i dont even know why i did the git thing. i just wanted an irc log search lol
09:09 < advil> heh
09:09 <@shmup> then zackoid, very late, made a comment about "not seeing the git thing" and
09:09 <@shmup> unsure exactly what he wanted.. i started a thing
09:09 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/?search=%21lg
09:10 <@shmup> i just wanna do that sometimes to remind myself of syntax
09:10 <@shmup> i Learn By Example (or never learn cause i rely on examples all the time)
09:10 < advil> hmm
09:11 < advil> we should put the lg docs in the topic
09:11 < advil> I can't set it myself though
09:11 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/docs/listgame.md
09:12 < advil> I do actually sometimes search the logs in crawl-dev for bot syntax too
09:17 < zackoid> shmup: i just meant the button said something about git on it, so i wasn't sure what i was looking at.  our i was hallucinating becuase i was tired.
09:58 < zackoid> advil: getting a lil' salty on the tavern huh
10:03 < advil> haha yes
10:03 < advil> it'll get ignored though probably
10:03 < advil> tavern is such a dysfunctional community
10:04 < advil> I get more and more fed up with it as time goes on

10:05 <@advil> hi :)
10:05 <@shmup> it did not say git on the button zackoid! lol
10:06 <@zackoid> advil: i agree and i stopped reading it for a long time.  but i think that particularly comment was just a n00b.
10:06 <@shmup> link?
10:06 <@shmup> to the advil-thread
10:06 <@advil> oh my saltiness is just a side-comment on a thread that was already split from something else
10:06 <@advil> zackoid: nago isn't a noob
10:06 <@advil> he used to be a blue name even
10:07 <@zackoid> ah i was referring to the guy who mentioned orb guardians to begin with
10:07 <@advil> lethediver is sort of maybe, if that's who you mean
10:07 <@advil> I kind of suspect lethediver is a sock
10:07 <@zackoid> i logged into the tavern for the first time ever yesterday, and almost posted a comment.  WHY THE HELL is the unread-thread text bolded, eye-searing bright red?
10:08 <@zackoid> heh you think that of everyone.
10:08 <@advil> well there's a continuous stream of semi-trolling noobs with weird strong opinions
10:08 <@advil> I guess crawl could just breed those
10:08 <@shmup> it is a nice looking phpBB forum
10:09 <@shmup> i never visit here, really. very very seldomly
10:09 <@advil> shmup https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=20967
10:10 <@advil> anyways that attitude about sequell is all over tavern, it annoys me
10:11 <@shmup> really? ha
10:11 <@shmup> > Where are the bot-queries-always-have-the-right-answers guys when they are really needed?
10:11 <@shmup> you are referring to that right?
10:11 <@zackoid> well it's true that just posting queries has a very low signal
10:11 <@advil> yeah
10:12 <@advil> it's true that there've been a few people who tended to use sequell queries incompetently in arguments and wouldn't stop
10:12 <@advil> bcadren was on iirc
10:12 <@zackoid> but by now people should be able to intuit what the data is actually saying, because the bias is the same one in most cases
10:12 <@advil> yeah
10:13 <@advil> some day I'm gonna import sequell data into some of the more sophisticated models we use in research
10:13 <@advil> it's not even as if the biases in the data can't be dealt with
10:14 <@zackoid> is there anything as powerful as player skill in the data you work with (that is not directly correlated with something easy to identify)?
10:14 <@shmup> that would be v interesting, advil 
10:16 <@advil> zackoid: probably not, but player skill should be correlated with a ton of easy things
10:16 <@advil> # games, # wins, for two
10:16 <@shmup> yeah
10:16 <@zackoid> it is DEFINITELY not correlated with games, heh
10:16 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained within wins
10:16 <@advil> and there is a lot of stuff around modeling variation between subjects
10:17 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained when obtaining runes (w/o win) in general
10:17 <@advil> I'm sure it correlates with # games, if you factor in individual differences
10:17 <@advil> there are very few people who could play hundreds of games without getting better in some way
10:18 <@zackoid> the guy who won shmup ghostkill award had 2000 in 3 months without winning.
10:18 <@zackoid> turns would be better, probably.
10:18 <@zackoid> maybe hours.
10:18 <@advil> well, but correlation has no commitment to there not being outliers
10:19 <@zackoid> yeah though i don't think that was really an extreme outlier.  bad players rack up games because they end so fast.
10:19 <@advil> and I would be surprised if even that guy didn't have some measurable improvement over those 2000 games
10:19 <@advil> just not improvement that involves winning
10:19 <@zackoid> and also most people, after they first win, get worse before they get better again i think.
10:19 <@advil> probably "skill" is fairly high dimensional
10:21 <@shmup> that person was likely a bot, also
10:21 <@advil> but I think you are thinking in too categorical terms :)
10:21 <@shmup> i kinda wish bots were allowed by required tagging in crawlrc heh
10:21 <@zackoid> i don't think that was a bot.
10:21 <@advil> I'm 95% sure that if you plotted # games and # wins, there'd be a clear linear correlation (even if that's not the best way to model it)
10:22 <@zackoid> well games vs wins would.  or do you mean skill vs games and wins
10:22 <@advil> well, I'm not sure that skill makes sense as a single dimensional-value
10:22 <@advil> but wins is a proxy for skill, presumably
10:22 <@zackoid> probably not.  i just meant that you can't win without playing another game
10:23 <@shmup> man
10:23 <@shmup> deep learning on some data would be fun

11:19 <@zackoid> well, 1.
11:23 <@zackoid> fortunately i looked at that before going into a half-hour diversion of looking up lava orc nutrition mechanics
16:50 <@zackoid> advil: R1 faculty sure are inbred huh
16:51 <@advil> probably
16:51 <@advil> it's worst at the top schools
16:51 <@advil> it's more like the top 10 in any given field are inbred
16:52 <@zackoid> i'm looking over where our faculty got their phds and it's the same handful of schools over and over.
16:52 <@zackoid> plus one santa cruz linguist, so i guess their linguistics department is better than the average there.
16:52 <@advil> yeah it's very godo
16:52 <@advil> *good
16:52 <@advil> (that's where I went)
16:53 <@zackoid> i saw a paper a few months ago that was using a network model for this and it verified that nobody hires from schools 'beneath' them, so at the top you can only hire for like 5 schools.
16:53 <@advil> probably the three ling departments with the best placement are MIT, UCSC, UMass Amherst
16:53 <@advil> maybe Stanford
16:53 <@advil> you've got all four I think?
16:54 <@zackoid> do we even have 4 linguistics faculty
16:54 <@advil> oh maybe no MIT
16:54 <@advil> 3 umass, one stanford, one (retired) UCSC
16:55 <@zackoid> uh shit i hope she retired in the last couple months
16:55 <@advil> I don't think so but I don't know the exact dates
16:56 <@zackoid> well shit.
16:56 <@zackoid> this should only be active faculty.
16:56 <@advil> she still has an appointment as a research associate
16:56 <@advil> http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/associates/gunlogson_christine/index.html
16:57 <@zackoid> ok, that's likely, this pool is all research + teaching staff.
17:00 <@zackoid> advil: since you were a product, is umass-boston a big thing or is the system just overwriting all umass schools with the first on the list
17:00 <@advil> umass boston is not a big thing
17:00 <@advil> "UMass" means UMass Amherst
17:01 <@advil> UMass Boston / UMass Lowell are ok local schools, lots of commuters / returning students, I think they might be R2s?
17:01 <@zackoid> i was suspicious because while i've heard of lowell i've never even heard of boston
17:01 <@advil> it's very unlikely that anyone who works at rochester has a Ph.D from UMass Boston
17:01 <@advil> (and no one in ling does)
17:01 <@zackoid> and a lot of the schools have really dumb names so i'm guessing some software is fucking it up
17:02 <@advil> I know someone who taught there through tenure and it was a shitty job
17:02 <@zackoid> heh one of them is a linguist
17:02 <@zackoid> and her CV says amherst.  bleh.
17:03 <@zackoid> actually 2/5 are linguists.  one more thing on the pile of corrections.
17:03 <@advil> haha good thing you know me!
17:04 <@zackoid> i did suspect something fishy but it's possible i would have been too drained of this crap to look it up if you hadn't provided an easy resource.
17:04 <@zackoid> so thanks.
17:05 <@advil> maybe this is why the dean's office always makes us give this stuff to them in like 3 different formats
17:07 <@advil> I think at least 3 people in your ling dept have degrees from UMass

17:20 <@zackoid> advil: is there any effort to make faculty have like perfectly standardized CV formats?
17:20 <@advil> haha no
17:20 <@advil> there's always some semi-standardized word template that they want us to use to convey the same information in addition to the CV though
17:21 <@advil> part if the issue is that bib standards vary by field

17:58 <@advil> well, I spent most of the afternoon doing bs administrative stuff too
17:58 <@advil> just from a desk in ottawa :-P
18:03 <@zackoid> are you writing up there?  you can't possibly have actual vacation time
18:03 <@advil> well, if you mean vacation time in a technical sense, keep in mind that most academics are on a 9 month salary
18:04 <@zackoid> yeah, but you're expected to fund yourself doing more work through the summer, no?
18:04 <@advil> so I'm not really even being paid for the summer (though I get my 9-month salary distributed through 12 months, also common)
18:04 <@advil> yeah, that is the culture
18:05 <@advil> I did take a real 10 day vacation in june, to Paris ;-)
18:07 <@zackoid> the first and last until you make tenure?
18:07 <@advil> there's not an expectation per se that I augment up to 12 months, but there is also the expectation that I don't sit around playing stardew valley all summer

19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[4/5]: Finally, stab damage gets an additional bonus multiplier of (12 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / {stab bonus}) / 12 for all weapons.
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[5
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[5/5]: (lower is better): sleeping/paralysed = 1, netted/webbed/petrifying/petrified = 2, invisible/confused/fleeing/ally = 4, distracted = 6
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[1
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[1/5]: A stab with a short blade does increased damage: (dam+bonus)*mult, where bonus depends on your dex as well as your stealth and weapon skills and is capped at 30, and mult depends on your stealth/weapon skills and the type of stab (sleep/paralysis is best). Non-short blades don't get a bonus and have lower mult. Daggers get bonus doubled (but still capped at 30).
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[3
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[3/5]: For short/long blades and one-handed polearms, stab damage gets a bonus multiplier of (10 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / ({stab bonus} + 2 (if using a long blade or one-handed polearm))) / 10

12:28 <@shmup> but i didnt check my race abilities
12:29 <@shmup> ???naga
12:29 < OCTOTROG> The player race has sInv, rPois, a poisonous spit attack, +5 stealth apt and natural stealth boosts, plus xl/3 natural AC. In return, they have a penalty to movement speed, receive halved base AC for body armours, and cannot wear boots (though bardings have 4 base AC). Nagas gain constriction at xl13. / Universally slow-moving (but normal attack speed); {Naga mage}s and {Greater Naga}
12:29 < OCTOTROG> use haste and conjurations to deal with this. All naga also have constriction. Basic {naga} are weak, while {Naga Warriors} are bulky and hit hard. A {Salamander} is essentially fire-themed Naga. Also see: {Naga Ritualist} {Salamander Firebrand} {Salamander Stormcaller} {Naga Sharpshooter}
12:38 <@zackoid> they can spit poison yeah
12:38 <@zackoid> and you really need to abuse it to survive
12:38 <@zackoid> they're strong eventually but one of the worst starting races because you can't run from anything
