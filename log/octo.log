16:26 <@shmup> lol
16:26 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/ghost-of-the-week.txt
16:27 <@shmup> but i'm trying to filter out bots, is the thing. i keep a list and only have 2 in it. there is no good query at the moment. was talking in dev about it.
16:28 <@shmup> i'm also working on a thing for http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/
16:28 < zackoid> that is not a public directory
16:28 <@shmup> octo / log
16:29 <@shmup> i'm gonna add an input up top for regex filtering. will not output any of our log here by default.
16:29 <@shmup> i started fresh so no previous history in log
16:29 < zackoid> i mean i just get a login prompt
16:29 <@shmup> yes, u: octo p: log
16:30 <@shmup> it's nothing atm. pointless to link really
16:30 < zackoid> oh
16:31 <@shmup> i can always grep my own log but earlier when you forgot the git command, i wish i had a frontend to quickly regex/grep shit out
16:31 <@shmup> from here
16:41 < zackoid> what, you don't log all of our wonderful banter for posterity?
16:48 <@shmup> haha
16:48 <@shmup> well by principle i log everything irc related :P
16:49 <@shmup> this is just a new special log, located elsewhere with permissions to read, ignoring things like nick changes etc
17:07 <@shmup> odiv_work: when we were "dieselrobin'ing" a few years back, I had no idea we were playing "dieselrobin"

21:20 <@shmup> zackoid: thoughts on http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/dev.php?search=git
21:21 <@shmup> i could make it so that i dont wrap the query in .* 
21:21 <@shmup> or i could leave it raw and just let the user do what is needed
21:21 <@shmup> aka they would need to .* around things, otherwise the pattern matching just returns the single pattern found in each line. not the whole line. . or i could revise that i guess
21:22 <@shmup> i could also give options to check like "dont search nicks"
21:31 < odiv> zackoid: Yeah, I just meant like what does your question mean?
21:31 < odiv> Obv you figured it out. :P
21:31 < odiv> ??hepliaklqana

Likes exploration. 0*: ally & recall, 2*: Remember Life, 3*: {Transference}, 4*: {Idealise}, 5*: Transference-slow
21:39 < zackoid> odiv: i ended up clearing them.  i just don't know how you survive if you don't.
21:42 < zackoid> shmup: so just a searchable log?  i don't see where the git happens
21:43 < odiv> Oh, you fuckin' book it. :P
21:44 < odiv> or you play tele roulette
21:44 < odiv> I should play again. I miss it.
21:51 < zackoid> but everything's gonna cut you off at the choke point
21:51 < zackoid> and tele is really dangerous since you have like a 40% chance of landing in the uncleared part

22:32 < OCTOTROG> Diarrea (L9 MiBe) killed the ghost of jinxplayer the Cleaver, a novice MiBe of Trog. (D:6) [cbro+]
23:14 <@shmup> oh zackoid no i just wanted to grep _this chan_ and i could look at previous commands you've done, etc
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: tell me the diff bot searching abilities sometime
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: i made another page to just grep git and list links to the raw source files (loads faster) but i'm not sure what all the search features are in botland
23:53 <@shmup> like you can search commit names? last commits? etc
23:56 < zackoid> i don't know that bot very well since i don't even know what it's called and don't know if there are any docs
23:56 < zackoid> one downside to having octotrog relay everything
23:57 < zackoid> there was a dblist entry that had basic help on all the bot operators but now i don't even remember what that was

00:04 < OCTOTROG> {SPEN}: <zackoid>	you sleep anything that you can sleep, you confuse anything you can confuse, you tukima anything with a weapon that you can tukima, you blind anything you can blind, you go invis against anything without sinv, in that order
00:04 < zackoid> i'm sure i was verbing tukima as a joke but it still hurts to read.
00:05 < zackoid> also i'd revise that because invis doesn't really go at the end, it depends.  invis has a lot of defensive benefits.
00:20 <@shmup> verbing things is nice all the time
00:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?search=slow
00:20 <@shmup> i can improve big time but if you have a thought let me know.. won't except patterns atm lol
00:22 <@shmup> things that are bad about linking to raw is line numbers are less useful :P i think i'll include regular link and [raw] after it
00:23 <@shmup> johnstein only once said "by johnstein"
