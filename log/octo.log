16:21 < zackoid> shmup: are you making a graph of the worst addicted players
16:26 <@shmup> lol
16:26 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/ghost-of-the-week.txt
16:27 <@shmup> but i'm trying to filter out bots, is the thing. i keep a list and only have 2 in it. there is no good query at the moment. was talking in dev about it.
16:28 <@shmup> i'm also working on a thing for http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/
16:28 < zackoid> that is not a public directory
16:28 <@shmup> octo / log
16:29 <@shmup> i'm gonna add an input up top for regex filtering. will not output any of our log here by default.
16:29 <@shmup> i started fresh so no previous history in log
16:29 < zackoid> i mean i just get a login prompt
16:29 <@shmup> yes, u: octo p: log
16:30 <@shmup> it's nothing atm. pointless to link really
16:30 < zackoid> oh
16:31 <@shmup> i can always grep my own log but earlier when you forgot the git command, i wish i had a frontend to quickly regex/grep shit out
16:31 <@shmup> from here
16:41 < zackoid> what, you don't log all of our wonderful banter for posterity?
16:48 <@shmup> haha
16:48 <@shmup> well by principle i log everything irc related :P
16:49 <@shmup> this is just a new special log, located elsewhere with permissions to read, ignoring things like nick changes etc

21:20 <@shmup> zackoid: thoughts on http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/dev.php?search=git
21:21 <@shmup> i could make it so that i dont wrap the query in .* 
21:21 <@shmup> or i could leave it raw and just let the user do what is needed
21:21 <@shmup> aka they would need to .* around things, otherwise the pattern matching just returns the single pattern found in each line. not the whole line. . or i could revise that i guess
21:22 <@shmup> i could also give options to check like "dont search nicks"
21:31 < odiv> zackoid: Yeah, I just meant like what does your question mean?
21:31 < odiv> Obv you figured it out. :P

21:39 < zackoid> odiv: i ended up clearing them.  i just don't know how you survive if you don't.
21:42 < zackoid> shmup: so just a searchable log?  i don't see where the git happens
21:43 < odiv> Oh, you fuckin' book it. :P
21:44 < odiv> or you play tele roulette
21:44 < odiv> I should play again. I miss it.
21:51 < zackoid> but everything's gonna cut you off at the choke point
21:51 < zackoid> and tele is really dangerous since you have like a 40% chance of landing in the uncleared part

23:14 <@shmup> oh zackoid no i just wanted to grep _this chan_ and i could look at previous commands you've done, etc
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: tell me the diff bot searching abilities sometime
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: i made another page to just grep git and list links to the raw source files (loads faster) but i'm not sure what all the search features are in botland
23:53 <@shmup> like you can search commit names? last commits? etc
23:56 < zackoid> i don't know that bot very well since i don't even know what it's called and don't know if there are any docs
23:56 < zackoid> one downside to having octotrog relay everything
23:57 < zackoid> there was a dblist entry that had basic help on all the bot operators but now i don't even remember what that was

00:04 < zackoid> ?!spen
00:04 < OCTOTROG> {SPEN}: <zackoid>	you sleep anything that you can sleep, you confuse anything you can confuse, you tukima anything with a weapon that you can tukima, you blind anything you can blind, you go invis against anything without sinv, in that order
00:04 < zackoid> i'm sure i was verbing tukima as a joke but it still hurts to read.
00:05 < zackoid> also i'd revise that because invis doesn't really go at the end, it depends.  invis has a lot of defensive benefits.
00:20 <@shmup> verbing things is nice all the time
00:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?search=slow
00:20 <@shmup> i can improve big time but if you have a thought let me know.. won't except patterns atm lol
00:22 <@shmup> things that are bad about linking to raw is line numbers are less useful :P i think i'll include regular link and [raw] after it
00:23 <@shmup> johnstein only once said "by johnstein"
00:23 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?grep=johnstein
00:42 < johnstein> shmup: authentication required
03:23 < Rotatell> johnstein: Unstable branch on crawl.beRotato.org updated to: 0.19-a0-1068-g99dd0f4 (34)
08:53 <@shmup> johnstein: octo/log
08:59 < advil> maybe useful to restrict to just the main source directory
09:00 < advil> to have an option that does that I mean
09:01 < advil> e.g. if you search for "hellion" there's a ton of misc results that you may or may not want, but the key link w.r.t. the source is just mon-data.h
09:03 <@shmup> that's fair, you mean the crawl-ref/source dir right?
09:03 < advil> yeah
09:03 < advil> or I suppose another way to do it would be by file type
09:04 < advil> .h vs .c vs .des vs misc or something
09:04 < advil> since you often do want to exclude .h from a grep
09:05 <@shmup> hm. def more thought needed.
09:05 <@shmup> also how i'm parsing results is kinda fucked. grep returns information separated by : and i'm being lazy and splitting on : atm.
09:06 <@shmup> however if the result actually contains a :, i'm gonna be doing things _wrong_
09:06 < advil>  haha that explains what's going on with the .des results then
09:06 <@shmup> yeah haha
09:06 <@shmup> exactly
09:06 <@shmup> this was a 12a thing i started and shouldn't have (cause 12a)
09:07 < advil> also uh stupid-ish question, have you played with github's code search?
09:07 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=hellion
09:07 <@shmup> i also think it might be best to just let you use raw regex, however having to do .*foo.* all the time (99% of the time) could be annoying. maybe i could compensnate somehow.
09:07 < advil> not that doing your own thing is bad or anything
09:08 <@shmup> yeah really i use that and just grepping locally
09:08 <@shmup> but .. a few of my browsers for whatever reason, choke on github cause it loads the fancy result page w/ line nums and shit.
09:08 <@shmup> i cant explain why it loads so poorly for me if a large file
09:08 <@shmup> so i always prefer to see the raw result
09:09 <@shmup> honestly man, i dont even know why i did the git thing. i just wanted an irc log search lol
09:09 < advil> heh
09:09 <@shmup> then zackoid, very late, made a comment about "not seeing the git thing" and
09:09 <@shmup> unsure exactly what he wanted.. i started a thing
09:09 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/?search=%21lg
09:10 <@shmup> i just wanna do that sometimes to remind myself of syntax
09:10 <@shmup> i Learn By Example (or never learn cause i rely on examples all the time)
09:10 < advil> hmm
09:11 < advil> we should put the lg docs in the topic
09:11 < advil> I can't set it myself though
09:11 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/docs/listgame.md
09:12 < advil> I do actually sometimes search the logs in crawl-dev for bot syntax too
09:17 < zackoid> shmup: i just meant the button said something about git on it, so i wasn't sure what i was looking at.  our i was hallucinating becuase i was tired.
09:58 < zackoid> advil: getting a lil' salty on the tavern huh
10:03 < advil> haha yes
10:03 < advil> it'll get ignored though probably
10:03 < advil> tavern is such a dysfunctional community
10:04 < advil> I get more and more fed up with it as time goes on

10:05 <@advil> hi :)
10:05 <@shmup> it did not say git on the button zackoid! lol
10:06 <@zackoid> advil: i agree and i stopped reading it for a long time.  but i think that particularly comment was just a n00b.
10:06 <@shmup> link?
10:06 <@shmup> to the advil-thread
10:06 <@advil> oh my saltiness is just a side-comment on a thread that was already split from something else
10:06 <@advil> zackoid: nago isn't a noob
10:06 <@advil> he used to be a blue name even
10:07 <@zackoid> ah i was referring to the guy who mentioned orb guardians to begin with
10:07 <@advil> lethediver is sort of maybe, if that's who you mean
10:07 <@advil> I kind of suspect lethediver is a sock
10:07 <@zackoid> i logged into the tavern for the first time ever yesterday, and almost posted a comment.  WHY THE HELL is the unread-thread text bolded, eye-searing bright red?
10:08 <@zackoid> heh you think that of everyone.
10:08 <@advil> well there's a continuous stream of semi-trolling noobs with weird strong opinions
10:08 <@advil> I guess crawl could just breed those
10:08 <@shmup> it is a nice looking phpBB forum
10:09 <@shmup> i never visit here, really. very very seldomly
10:09 <@advil> shmup https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=20967
10:10 <@advil> anyways that attitude about sequell is all over tavern, it annoys me
10:11 <@shmup> really? ha
10:11 <@shmup> > Where are the bot-queries-always-have-the-right-answers guys when they are really needed?
10:11 <@shmup> you are referring to that right?
10:11 <@zackoid> well it's true that just posting queries has a very low signal
10:11 <@advil> yeah
10:12 <@advil> it's true that there've been a few people who tended to use sequell queries incompetently in arguments and wouldn't stop
10:12 <@advil> bcadren was on iirc
10:12 <@zackoid> but by now people should be able to intuit what the data is actually saying, because the bias is the same one in most cases
10:12 <@advil> yeah
10:13 <@advil> some day I'm gonna import sequell data into some of the more sophisticated models we use in research
10:13 <@advil> it's not even as if the biases in the data can't be dealt with
10:14 <@zackoid> is there anything as powerful as player skill in the data you work with (that is not directly correlated with something easy to identify)?
10:14 <@shmup> that would be v interesting, advil 
10:16 <@advil> zackoid: probably not, but player skill should be correlated with a ton of easy things
10:16 <@advil> # games, # wins, for two
10:16 <@shmup> yeah
10:16 <@zackoid> it is DEFINITELY not correlated with games, heh
10:16 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained within wins
10:16 <@advil> and there is a lot of stuff around modeling variation between subjects
10:17 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained when obtaining runes (w/o win) in general
10:17 <@advil> I'm sure it correlates with # games, if you factor in individual differences
10:17 <@advil> there are very few people who could play hundreds of games without getting better in some way
10:18 <@zackoid> the guy who won shmup ghostkill award had 2000 in 3 months without winning.
10:18 <@zackoid> turns would be better, probably.
10:18 <@zackoid> maybe hours.
10:18 <@advil> well, but correlation has no commitment to there not being outliers
10:19 <@zackoid> yeah though i don't think that was really an extreme outlier.  bad players rack up games because they end so fast.
10:19 <@advil> and I would be surprised if even that guy didn't have some measurable improvement over those 2000 games
10:19 <@advil> just not improvement that involves winning
10:19 <@zackoid> and also most people, after they first win, get worse before they get better again i think.
10:19 <@advil> probably "skill" is fairly high dimensional
10:21 <@shmup> that person was likely a bot, also
10:21 <@advil> but I think you are thinking in too categorical terms :)
10:21 <@shmup> i kinda wish bots were allowed by required tagging in crawlrc heh
10:21 <@zackoid> i don't think that was a bot.
10:21 <@advil> I'm 95% sure that if you plotted # games and # wins, there'd be a clear linear correlation (even if that's not the best way to model it)
10:22 <@zackoid> well games vs wins would.  or do you mean skill vs games and wins
10:22 <@advil> well, I'm not sure that skill makes sense as a single dimensional-value
10:22 <@advil> but wins is a proxy for skill, presumably
10:22 <@zackoid> probably not.  i just meant that you can't win without playing another game
10:23 <@shmup> man
10:23 <@shmup> deep learning on some data would be fun

11:19 <@zackoid> well, 1.
11:23 <@zackoid> fortunately i looked at that before going into a half-hour diversion of looking up lava orc nutrition mechanics
16:50 <@zackoid> advil: R1 faculty sure are inbred huh
16:51 <@advil> probably
16:51 <@advil> it's worst at the top schools
16:51 <@advil> it's more like the top 10 in any given field are inbred
16:52 <@zackoid> i'm looking over where our faculty got their phds and it's the same handful of schools over and over.
16:52 <@zackoid> plus one santa cruz linguist, so i guess their linguistics department is better than the average there.
16:52 <@advil> yeah it's very godo
16:52 <@advil> *good
16:52 <@advil> (that's where I went)
16:53 <@zackoid> i saw a paper a few months ago that was using a network model for this and it verified that nobody hires from schools 'beneath' them, so at the top you can only hire for like 5 schools.
16:53 <@advil> probably the three ling departments with the best placement are MIT, UCSC, UMass Amherst
16:53 <@advil> maybe Stanford
16:53 <@advil> you've got all four I think?
16:54 <@zackoid> do we even have 4 linguistics faculty
16:54 <@advil> oh maybe no MIT
16:54 <@advil> 3 umass, one stanford, one (retired) UCSC
16:55 <@zackoid> uh shit i hope she retired in the last couple months
16:55 <@advil> I don't think so but I don't know the exact dates
16:56 <@zackoid> well shit.
16:56 <@zackoid> this should only be active faculty.
16:56 <@advil> she still has an appointment as a research associate
16:56 <@advil> http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/associates/gunlogson_christine/index.html
16:57 <@zackoid> ok, that's likely, this pool is all research + teaching staff.
17:00 <@zackoid> advil: since you were a product, is umass-boston a big thing or is the system just overwriting all umass schools with the first on the list
17:00 <@advil> umass boston is not a big thing
17:00 <@advil> "UMass" means UMass Amherst
17:01 <@advil> UMass Boston / UMass Lowell are ok local schools, lots of commuters / returning students, I think they might be R2s?
17:01 <@zackoid> i was suspicious because while i've heard of lowell i've never even heard of boston
17:01 <@advil> it's very unlikely that anyone who works at rochester has a Ph.D from UMass Boston
17:01 <@advil> (and no one in ling does)
17:01 <@zackoid> and a lot of the schools have really dumb names so i'm guessing some software is fucking it up
17:02 <@advil> I know someone who taught there through tenure and it was a shitty job
17:02 <@zackoid> heh one of them is a linguist
17:02 <@zackoid> and her CV says amherst.  bleh.
17:03 <@zackoid> actually 2/5 are linguists.  one more thing on the pile of corrections.
17:03 <@advil> haha good thing you know me!
17:04 <@zackoid> i did suspect something fishy but it's possible i would have been too drained of this crap to look it up if you hadn't provided an easy resource.
17:04 <@zackoid> so thanks.
17:05 <@advil> maybe this is why the dean's office always makes us give this stuff to them in like 3 different formats
17:07 <@advil> I think at least 3 people in your ling dept have degrees from UMass

17:20 <@zackoid> advil: is there any effort to make faculty have like perfectly standardized CV formats?
17:20 <@advil> haha no
17:20 <@advil> there's always some semi-standardized word template that they want us to use to convey the same information in addition to the CV though
17:21 <@advil> part if the issue is that bib standards vary by field

17:58 <@advil> well, I spent most of the afternoon doing bs administrative stuff too
17:58 <@advil> just from a desk in ottawa :-P
18:03 <@zackoid> are you writing up there?  you can't possibly have actual vacation time
18:03 <@advil> well, if you mean vacation time in a technical sense, keep in mind that most academics are on a 9 month salary
18:04 <@zackoid> yeah, but you're expected to fund yourself doing more work through the summer, no?
18:04 <@advil> so I'm not really even being paid for the summer (though I get my 9-month salary distributed through 12 months, also common)
18:04 <@advil> yeah, that is the culture
18:05 <@advil> I did take a real 10 day vacation in june, to Paris ;-)
18:07 <@zackoid> the first and last until you make tenure?
18:07 <@advil> there's not an expectation per se that I augment up to 12 months, but there is also the expectation that I don't sit around playing stardew valley all summer

19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[4/5]: Finally, stab damage gets an additional bonus multiplier of (12 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / {stab bonus}) / 12 for all weapons.
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[5
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[5/5]: (lower is better): sleeping/paralysed = 1, netted/webbed/petrifying/petrified = 2, invisible/confused/fleeing/ally = 4, distracted = 6
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[1
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[1/5]: A stab with a short blade does increased damage: (dam+bonus)*mult, where bonus depends on your dex as well as your stealth and weapon skills and is capped at 30, and mult depends on your stealth/weapon skills and the type of stab (sleep/paralysis is best). Non-short blades don't get a bonus and have lower mult. Daggers get bonus doubled (but still capped at 30).
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[3
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[3/5]: For short/long blades and one-handed polearms, stab damage gets a bonus multiplier of (10 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / ({stab bonus} + 2 (if using a long blade or one-handed polearm))) / 10

12:28 <@shmup> but i didnt check my race abilities
12:29 <@shmup> ???naga
12:29 < OCTOTROG> The player race has sInv, rPois, a poisonous spit attack, +5 stealth apt and natural stealth boosts, plus xl/3 natural AC. In return, they have a penalty to movement speed, receive halved base AC for body armours, and cannot wear boots (though bardings have 4 base AC). Nagas gain constriction at xl13. / Universally slow-moving (but normal attack speed); {Naga mage}s and {Greater Naga}
12:29 < OCTOTROG> use haste and conjurations to deal with this. All naga also have constriction. Basic {naga} are weak, while {Naga Warriors} are bulky and hit hard. A {Salamander} is essentially fire-themed Naga. Also see: {Naga Ritualist} {Salamander Firebrand} {Salamander Stormcaller} {Naga Sharpshooter}
12:38 <@zackoid> they can spit poison yeah
12:38 <@zackoid> and you really need to abuse it to survive
12:38 <@zackoid> they're strong eventually but one of the worst starting races because you can't run from anything

10:01 <@shmup> you can really really really start out unluckily as a caster
10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a rat on D:1, with 4 points after 46 turns and 0:01:06. [cbro+]
10:02 <@shmup> lol

10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a giant gecko on D:1, with 2 points after 44 turns and 0:00:34. [cbro+]
10:02 <@zackoid> it's not so much unlucky as you're lucky when you're not killed by the first think you meet.
10:03 <@zackoid> giant gecko is probably the wost possible first monster now.
10:03 <@zackoid> rats or bats are the best.
10:04 <@shmup> yeah, fair. lucky wasn't even what i was feeling
10:05 <@shmup> well in rat scenario it was starting and i could situate myself so only 1 thing could get me.
10:05 <@shmup> but it was.. 5 rats? 1 kobold? then a final rat? or something.
10:05 <@zackoid> yah that's pretty bad.
10:05 < OCTOTROG> shmup (L1 HOFE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
10:05 <@zackoid> if there's something you can do about that i don't know what it is.
10:06 <@shmup> my best chance so far was when i found a spear instantly. then an enchanted dagger i should not have equipped ;)
10:07 <@advil> for a caster start a first priority is to find somewhere where you can pillar dance
10:07 <@zackoid> now that monster-generated weapons are identified i never pick up anything blue off the ground until i have a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> i heard someone else say that recently but i don't get it
10:08 <@shmup> why not hold in inventory?
10:08 <@shmup> it's not like you're gonna hit max inv by time you get a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> well, unlikely
10:09 <@zackoid> i think the early generation is biased toward cursed stuff but i don't know that
10:09 <@zackoid> and 95% of the time by the time i would want any of that i have a decent weapon anyway
10:45 < necKro> we could just add a .. that works like !!
10:45 < necKro> or something
10:46 <@zackoid> are there any . commands that are useful?
10:49 <@advil> I'm not sure what "." means conventionally as opposed to "!"
10:49 <@advil> but some of them could be useful I guess
10:50 <@advil> that is, they don't seem any less useful than the ! ones, just sometimes a bit more special purpose
10:50 <@advil> lots of ones that trigger specific tvs, or find specific kinds of killers, or deaths on particular maps
10:50 <@advil> like johnstein has .hsmap
10:50 <@advil> er
10:50 <@advil> .jsmap
10:51 <@advil> it's the = ones that aren't very useful on their own
11:34 <@shmup> scroll through the list, zackoid .

12:25 <@shmup> you think vehemut, zackoid?
12:27 <@zackoid> depends if you want to hit things with axes or blast
12:30 <@shmup> i only picked up the damn axe cause i thought i wanted a weapon
12:31 <@shmup> i wanna blast. but i did put 6 points in my axe
12:31 <@shmup> which obv it'd need more. shit
12:31 <@shmup> what would you go with if you wanted to axe but still blast a bit. some armour/weapon god? 
12:33 <@zackoid> i usually use ash for that case, but ash is kinda tough if you're not used to blasters 'cause xhe doesn't provide a lot of help early on.  i think vehumet is the easiest way to learn the conj playstyle.
12:33 <@zackoid> axes are just XP hungry relative to other weapons, though the apt might balance that out i'm not sure

10:24 <@zackoid> pfft not even a full-health 1-shot
10:24 <@zackoid> did you drag that up from d:3
10:24 <@zackoid> ?
10:27 <@shmup> yeah. i left it behind and then chose the wrong stairs later.
10:28 <@zackoid> one of the dumbest lessons that took me too long to learn was not to go (immediately) back down the same stairs you just narrowly escaped via
10:28 <@zackoid> also to use X-e
10:28 <@shmup> that's not what happened but that is a good lesson
10:29 <@shmup> i just happened to go back to the same stairs after doing other things
10:29 <@zackoid> yeah i know what you meant, what i'm talking about is much dumber
10:29 <@zackoid> but it is a good idea to drop exclusions for that reason
10:29 <@shmup> ahh. X-e though? sec
10:29 <@shmup> oh i should do that ^
10:30 <@shmup> i def 10000% wanna start doing that actually

10:30 <@shmup> yes..
10:30 <@shmup> damn.
10:44 <@advil> it's a very good idea, especially on a non noisy char
10:45 <@advil> I find that in lair I set 1-4 exclusions per level routinely
10:51 <@zackoid> and then you auto-travel to the edge of your exclusion and wake up a different monster that wakes up the one you excluded.

13:07 <@zackoid> ??energy randomization
13:07 < OCTOTROG> energy randomisation[1/3]: Every time a monster makes a movement (i.e. not an attack/spell), the amount of time taken to do its turn has a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns slower, a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns quicker and a 1/3 chance of being the normal amount. Over time, these 0.1s add up or cancel out to cause 'double moves' or 'lost moves'.
13:07 <@shmup> okay so i went for it on purpose tho cause i was a bit stealthy
13:07 <@shmup> and got up on it and got it to yellow but then

13:08 <@shmup> i was just commenting on speed
13:08 <@zackoid> i think you want to learn conj flame before sticky probs
13:08 <@zackoid> conj flame is really good and much easier to cast
13:09 <@zackoid> also totally forget about stabs
13:09 <@zackoid> try to kill everything at the edge of LoS
13:09 <@zackoid> stab power depends on having stealth and shortblade skill
13:09 <@zackoid> also if an ogre is asleep on D:3 let it sleep.
13:10 <@shmup> oh, all right
13:10 <@shmup> yeah i havent tried conj once yet
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[1/2]: A level 3 spell that creates a cloud of flame in the selected unoccupied space. Many weaker monsters will be unwilling to cross it, but some tougher or less intelligent ones will.
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame[2
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[2/2]: Usage: Fight in corridors. Lure things into corridors. Conjure flame in front of them.
13:10 <@zackoid> the unoccupied place is the most important thing to remember, you have to use it before the monster gets to you
13:10 <@zackoid> but it lets you seal off halways from weak things and blast at your leisure
13:10 <@zackoid> strong things and dumb things will walk right through it, but it does good damage especially if you can trap them in it or chain them
13:24 <@shmup> i don't wanna ever exist in a world where a high elf can't outrun an ogre btw

Always has a cloak. Random colour. Like an ogre, he can deal up to 35 or so damage in one shot. Or paralyse or banish you.

09:43 <@shmup> i'm still uncertain about conjure flame
09:43 <@shmup> i've only tried it a bit, but even an adder won't walk in the damn thing.
09:43 <@advil> uncertain?
09:43 <@shmup> like, not familiar with it
09:43 <@advil> ah
09:43 <@shmup> not sure how dumb is dumb re: mob brains
09:43 <@advil> it's very, very good
09:43 <@zackoid> adder not walking into it is good
09:43 <@shmup> fair
09:44 <@zackoid> only really dumb weak things will walk into it
09:44 <@shmup> so you use it to gain distance AND maybe deal damage if they're super dumb
09:44 <@zackoid> really dumb means mostly zombocoms and skeletons
09:44 <@advil> whether something with brains will walk into it depends on hp, so it's hard to predict
09:44 <@shmup> okay yeah no that does change my viewpoint re distance
09:44 <@zackoid> STRONG things will just not gaf
09:44 <@advil> insects too?
09:44 <@zackoid> though it depends on how much HP they have at the time

09:45 <@advil> maybe not any more
09:45 <@zackoid> ??monster intelligence
09:45 < OCTOTROG> monster intelligence[1/12]: From worst to best: Brainless, Animal, Human. This has many effects on monster behaviour, most notably pursuing you longer, pathfinding better, being more wary of traps/clouds and moving in ways that inconviences you more.
09:45 <@zackoid> there used to be more, right?
09:45 <@advil> yeah
09:46 <@advil> flame cloud is reliable for damaging heavy things, uniques, hydras, that sort of monster
09:46 <@advil> otherwise you use it to trap something while you shoot it or poke at it with a polearm
09:48 <@advil> oh the other thing is that if something's already in a cloud, it will freely walk to more clouds
09:48 <@advil> situationally useful to know
09:49 <@shmup> trying to figure out X-e more.
09:49 <@shmup> by default it fills all rooms visible red, autotravel excluded? but i can press again to just mark single ones (white) and.. those are excluded.. but surrounding is all red still?
09:49 <@zackoid> the 'in another cloud' part is more important with freezing cloud since you can drop that on top of monsters
09:50 <@shmup> i just wanna say "this stair is excluded"
09:50 <@shmup> "stop me if i'm gonna try going up it"
09:50 <@shmup> "or tell me rather"
09:50 <@zackoid> once is LOS from the spot, twice is the spot itself, thrice is clear
09:50 <@shmup> okay well that's what i don't like ^
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a regular spot it changes color
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a stair it does not
09:50 <@shmup> re: spot itself/twice
09:50 <@zackoid> #consoleproblems
09:50 <@shmup> lol
09:51 <@advil> I think technically when you set it on a stair the exclusion is on the other floor
09:51 <@advil> so it'll show there
09:51 <@zackoid> on tiles it works normally
09:51 <@shmup> ty it worked. 
09:51 <@shmup> i mean it yelled at me when trying to go up

09:53 <@zackoid> johnstein: this is wrong, right?
09:53 <@zackoid> https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=21032
09:54 <@zackoid> i've used wizmode on dbro but i thought that was disabled for most people.
09:56 < johnstein> both cbro and dbro compile for wizmode
09:56 < johnstein> on cbro there's dgamelaunch Magic to check if you are a glad
09:56 < johnstein> uh
09:56 < johnstein> if you are a dgladmin
09:57 < johnstein> ie on the admin list. only devs and the occasional other server admin's are on the list and it's a manual process
09:57 < johnstein> so gammafunk can play wizmode on cbro
09:57 < johnstein> and everyone can play wizmode on dbro
09:58 < johnstein> and I'm not sure about the load concern. but I remember someone (some dev?) said there are mild security concerns
09:58 < johnstein> but no one elaborated when I asked for specifics. probably with mildly good reason
09:58 < johnstein> ie not discussing them openly in a chat room with a public searchable log
09:59 < johnstein> I should reply in that thread.  but ugh, Tavern
10:01 <@zackoid> i just thought it odd that a non-admin would talk about using wizmode on CBRO
10:01 < johnstein> oh did I read it wrong?
10:01 < johnstein> he says 8081
10:01 < johnstein> that's dbro
10:01 <@zackoid> ah.
10:01 <@zackoid> i always used dev.
10:02 < johnstein> my snarky reply is, "I can't Believe any lamers aren't using the dev.berotato.org address for dbro"
10:02 <@zackoid> they better not blow up my secret wizmode spot.

13:34 <@zackoid> ah the old double shaft
13:44 <@zackoid> i wonder how hard it would be to have a bot command that fetched the skills, stats, slot a and slot b items from a current dump, launch a crawl instance, fsim weapon a and b, and dump the results back.  everything except returning the results could be done with command line scripting and internal lua i think, though it'd be pretty hacky
13:45 <@zackoid> how hacky depending on if lua can read from arbitrary files.
13:47 <@zackoid> probably the whole thing could be done with pexpect
14:29 <@shmup> what is fsim, zackoid?

14:31 <@zackoid> wizmode fight simulator.  
14:31 <@zackoid> i most use it to compare weapons
14:31 <@zackoid> mostly
14:39 <@zackoid> why is this in the crawl FAQ under 'easy gods for new players': "The most straightforward gods to play are probably Trog or Okawaru (for melee and ranged combat), Vehumet or Sif Muna (for spellcasting), and Yredelemnul (for undead allies). Also, while unreliable, Xom can be a lot of fun."
14:39 <@zackoid> that is an awful answer.
14:40 <@shmup> haha
14:40 <@shmup> indeed
14:45 <@zackoid> even ignoring the xom part, sif is one of the worst gods for a new player and yred, while strong, involves ally management, one of the most frustrating things in crawl.
14:55 <@shmup> what two spelling casting gods would you recommend
14:56 <@zackoid> for a beginner i would not recommend casting at all, and framing it as casting god vs not is problematic anyway.  but if someone was trying to learn how to play a primary-conjurations character i would say vehumet, because vehumet is very straightforward.

14:16 <@shmup> shit zackoid okay so I discovered a thing..
14:16 <@shmup> pr much in this highlighted area: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/fight.cc#L756-L787
14:17 <@shmup> i had to do 5 of those checks for various things, ignoring branding (obv)
14:17 <@shmup> but i wasnt doing the 772-774 shit. it did change my numbers for at least crossbows. need to check others. but.. curious if you can help verify that they're actually right now.
14:19 <@zackoid> i thiiiink short blades and crossbows are the only exceptions to .7 rule
14:19 <@zackoid> outside of unrands
14:20 <@shmup> well if you could peek again whenever
14:20 <@shmup> are you on git or 18
14:20 <@shmup> .18
14:20 <@zackoid> git.
14:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/dcss-weapons.txt
14:20 <@zackoid> next tournament will be around novemberish probably
14:21 <@zackoid> crossbow skill reqs are still wrong on that
14:21 <@zackoid> ??club
14:21 < OCTOTROG> club[1/2]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 5 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay). A heavy piece of wood. Bad.
14:21 <@zackoid> weird.
14:21 <@shmup> man i need to reserve iceland room ASAP i am being a shithead
14:21 <@shmup> you reminded me cause maybe i will be in iceland during the tournament
14:22 <@shmup> hmmmmmmmmm
14:22 <@shmup> @ what you just said
14:22 < odiv> Octopodes are OP
14:22 <@zackoid> odiv: you typed o instead of u
14:22 <@shmup> he was making a joke yo
14:23 <@zackoid> about uctopodes?
14:23 <@shmup> lol
14:23 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc won Op-- s=name,class
14:23 < OCTOTROG> 12 games for @mfc (won Op--): 2x murphyslaw (Artificer, Transmuter), 2x TheNoid (Berserker, Venom Mage), Kramin (Berserker), isthmus (Berserker), kaibutsu (Berserker), valrus (Skald), odiv (Wizard), advil (Ice Elementalist), zackoid (Ice Elementalist), slitherrr (Venom Mage)
14:23 <@zackoid> i'm not using a shield which feels like suicide but i have this amazing arbalest
14:24 < odiv> So at least you'll die feeling like a badass.
14:24 <@zackoid> but i can't afford to train it up so it shoots at 1.5 delay
14:24 <@zackoid> so i feel like i'm making a horrible stategic mistake
14:26 <@shmup> so you're specifically saying my skill required and min delay is wrong
14:26 <@shmup> not the first 3 numbers that require no modification (come straight from source as defined)
14:27 <@shmup> dmg/hit/base-delay that is
14:27 <@zackoid> those look fine yeah
14:27 <@shmup> OK. well. man. how do you know they're wrong btw
14:27 <@shmup> i believe you of course lol
14:28 <@zackoid> it says in game.
14:28 <@shmup> ohh, okay
14:28 <@zackoid> also triple xbows requiring 32 skill was a little suspicious
14:28 <@shmup> yeah heh well i did address that but
14:28 <@zackoid> if you fix the mindelay (it's 1.0) the skill will fix itself
14:28 <@shmup> can you tell me what one of them are btw?
14:28 <@shmup> either for hand or triple
14:28 <@shmup> or whatever i guess heh
14:29 <@zackoid> skill is 10/18 for sure...26 i think for triple
14:29 <@shmup> ok ty
14:34 <@zackoid> i have 8 ring slots and only MR+.
14:37 <@shmup> lol
14:39 <@helicomatic> more games need octopus style imo
14:39 <@helicomatic> that actually made me real mad in diablo when I was a kid, you have 10 fingers but 2 rings
14:41 <@shmup> i wanna see the wiki list of games that let's you wear a ring on every finger

14:59 <@helicomatic> live by the crossbow, die by the crossbow
15:00 <@zackoid> The vault warden hits you from afar with a vampiric glaive!!!
15:00 <@zackoid> was the bigger issue.
15:00 <@helicomatic> ah
15:00 <@helicomatic> those are long
15:03 <@shmup> dang
15:06 <@zackoid> i think that situation might have been literally unsurvivable once the convoker fired.  maybe an immediate double blink before even taking damage, but even that would have been iffy.

12:45 <@zackoid> are you ughing both?
12:45 < odiv> I need to get back into this.
12:45 < odiv> instead of just at tournament time
12:46 <@shmup> no you don't
12:46 <@shmup> do you feel like playing right now
13:26 < advil> the TrHu is at least novel, but DgAr is one of those rolls that makes you not want to play by hyper rules
13:28 <@zackoid> do the rules exclude 'accidently' taking one step too many with an adder in LoS?

14:13 <@zackoid> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/a75ee9761a89626fe171cf83823357b1ab0daba3
14:13 <@zackoid> that one is pretty big.
14:13 < advil> that pakellas wrath went on forever?
14:13 <@zackoid> yeah.
14:13 <@zackoid> so you never had MP regen again
14:16 < advil> that stair change is interesting
14:17 < advil> I'm pretty sure I have chars that would have been alive if that change were in place
14:18 <@zackoid> white very ugly thing vs tengu?
14:19 <@zackoid> i don't intuitively grasp the difference in the speed, but i guess it might mean that a very faster monster might attack you at the top of the stairs before you can act again now?
14:19 < advil> why yes, I'm glad you remember my painful deaths too :-P
14:19 < advil> yeah seems that way...maybe a slight nerf to ac chars
14:20 <@zackoid> it helps to distribute all the built up salt i have from my last game
14:21 < advil> haha
14:21 < advil> is that the optm I saw in the backlog?
14:22 <@zackoid> yeah, though it was more a combination of losing 6 previously to that, all to fast monsters i had no way of dealing with at xl10.  so i finally broke through that wall and had two runes and then died in two turns.
14:23 <@zackoid> MR+ and 6AC is not a solid combination in vaults.  without stoneskin existing you're really dependent on finding statue form i think.
14:26 <@zackoid> the real, deep-down problem is that for some dumb reason i really like form changers but the best form changer races are extremely frail (fe, op, dr is ok).  and there's no guarantee you'll actually get the useful forms.
14:34 < advil> I've never really gotten in to form changers for some reason
14:35 < advil> my one really strong one had such good unarmed it was unnecessary to actually change forms
14:35 <@zackoid> anything that can wear body armour is probably better off just using BH.  and only then if they don't have claws.
14:36 < advil> even blade hands didn't really seem worth it on that char
14:38 <@zackoid> was it a naga of chei?
14:38 < advil> yep

14:39 <@zackoid> chei worshippers hit hard enough that they already do a lot of overkill
14:40 <@zackoid> my naga of chei used blade hands 191 times.  whereas a mftm of ash used it 757 times.
14:44 < advil> I used it all of 64 times
14:47 < advil> it doesn't help that I kind of like the aesthetic of punching orbs of fire to death

16:53 < odiv> that's a good q
17:08 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil the Charlatan (L2 DgAr), slain by a goblin (a +0 club) (led by Robin) on D:2, with 31 points after 1415 turns and 0:06:26. [cbro+]
17:09 < advil> robin with a wand of slowing is tougher than regular robin
17:09 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L1 DsWn) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
17:10 <@zackoid> hyperezmode
17:10 <@zackoid> advil: i recommend uskayaw.
17:10 < advil> it's a pretty lame wn start
17:10 < advil> a +2 short sword and 2 curing potions
17:10 <@zackoid> mine was 4.0 summoning skill with 2 necro spells.
17:10 < advil> I think all my other wanderer successes have had books
17:11 <@zackoid> 2 curing is pretty dang powerful though
17:12 < advil> hm I have 2 hexes
17:14 <@zackoid> which reminds me
17:14 <@zackoid> !!oneandwon
17:14 < OCTOTROG> Chars won first try for zackoid: KoAK, HOVM, HuIE, HOMo, TeAE, MiAr, OgFi, DrWz, DsBe, CeNe, GhFi, DsWn, FoAK, HEIE
17:16 < advil> did 0 skill throwing get slightly better again?
17:16 < advil> rocks are doing more damage than I expect
17:30 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) killed the ghost of Stef the Magician, an amateur DEIE of Nemelex Xobeh. (D:4) [cbro+]
17:31 < advil> for once, guardian comes through
17:33 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) killed Natasha. (D:3) [cbro+]
17:34 < advil> ??uskayaw
17:34 < OCTOTROG> uskayaw[1/5]: God of ecstatic dance. Piety raises very quickly as you deal damage and drops very quickly over time. *: Stomp for AOE damage. **: Teleport through a line of creatures, confusing them. ***: on reaching this piety level, briefly paralyze all enemies in LOS. ****: On reaching this piety level, monsters share damage. *****: Telefrag any monster in LOS.
17:35 <@zackoid> advil: i think it's only the DPS that changed
17:35 <@zackoid> i'm really interested in trying uskayaw in a zig
17:35 <@zackoid> but i'm not interested in getting there, because i hate extended.
17:35 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) became a worshipper of Uskayaw. (D:3) [cbro+]
17:36 < advil> I doubt this one will make it that far
17:36 < advil> having fairly bad luck
17:36 <@zackoid> i only suggested it because i just did a dswn of uskayaw as my last win
17:36 < advil> well, I haven't tried uskayaw
17:37 < advil> and it's the 3rd altar I've found
17:37 <@zackoid> but ds is way hardiers than any of the other species i tried with usk.  i picked it mostly because i wanted to see how it'd be with something stronk, but i didn't want to do mi
17:37 < advil> usk is invocations?
17:37 < advil> seems like I can train it now
17:37 < advil> ???uskayaw
17:37 < OCTOTROG> God of ecstatic dance. Piety raises very quickly as you deal damage and drops very quickly over time. *: Stomp for AOE damage. **: Teleport through a line of creatures, confusing them. ***: on reaching this piety level, briefly paralyze all enemies in LOS. ****: On reaching this piety level, monsters share damage. *****: Telefrag any monster in LOS. / *: Stomp. **: Line Pass. *****:
17:37 < OCTOTROG> Grand Finale. Upon reaching ***, briefly and irresistably paralyze all monsters in LOS. Upon reaching ****, pain bond all monsters in LOS. The *** and **** powers can be triggered once per 30 turns. All powers scale heavily w/ Invo. / reasons <namelastname112> The balrug is hit by a flying piece of Cerebov! /

17:37 <@zackoid> yeah
17:38 < advil> what invoc do I want?
17:38 <@zackoid> it scales up pretty heavily at first, but i'm not sure where the dimishing returns are
17:38 <@zackoid> the more the better, especially with Ds apt
17:38 < advil> yeah, I always forget about that aptitude
17:38 < advil> how does usk interact with allies?
17:38 < advil> should have asked that first
17:39 < advil> I have guardian
17:39 <@zackoid> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue//zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20160809-024758.txt
17:39 <@zackoid> i actually ended up all the way at 26, but the 15 is more indicative probably
17:39 <@zackoid> interact how?
17:40 <@zackoid> i don't know if their damage contributes to piety
17:40 < advil> do they block these moving around abilities?
17:40 <@zackoid> i don't recall
17:40 <@zackoid> i think you can add them to the confuse chain and i don't think he cares
17:41 <@zackoid> but i only had undead allies in that game
17:41 < advil> is any weapon school better than others with usk?
17:42 <@zackoid> i did long blades because he gives two types of stab opportunities, so i trained short blades early and long blades when i found them.  eventually i rarely switched, but in the midgame it can be helpful to get the stabs
17:42 <@zackoid> axes help build piety faster
17:42 <@zackoid> faith is REALLY good
17:42 <@zackoid> the early-mid game is all about getting above the damage curve, but once you are it's really fun
17:43 < advil> I was aiming for long blades since I still don't have a new longblade win, but I haven't exactly found one
17:44 < advil> though there's a randart long sword in a shop
17:44 <@zackoid> any book (or wn) start you are usually using shortblades for a long time anyway

17:45 <@zackoid> heh, 17 feels like ancient history with how many of those spells have been removed
17:47 <@zackoid> what do you think is actually a required zig kit?
17:49 < advil> I'm not sure I have a general answer
17:49 < advil> I went in the first time with only some of that stuff and it wasn't enough, for a DE caster
17:50 < advil> iirc  I didn't have firestorm or necromutation the first time
17:50 <@zackoid> well a level 9 spell and channeling and either MP or HP on kills seems to be popular
17:50 < advil> I got a really bad mummy floor and only survived via fog
17:50 < advil> oh yeah I didn't have the cboe online the first time either
17:50 < advil> just vehumet isn't really enough

17:54 < advil> for boolean disjunction use (( p || q ))
17:54 <@zackoid> it's so hard to read zig logs because everything is clumped in 27

17:58 <@zackoid> both on mummy levels
18:00 <@zackoid> that's the problem with zigs
18:00 <@zackoid> though i guess in this case it's megazigs.  but still gozag->TSO just to grind to the point where you can start.
18:01 < advil> zombies show damage now?
18:02 <@zackoid> yeah.
18:02 <@zackoid> and also heal maybe?
18:03 < advil> the +8 long sword of Undoing {slice, MR- Str+4 Int+4}
18:03 < advil> pity about that MR
18:04 <@zackoid> that's pretty good until after lair

18:05 < OCTOTROG> vehumet wrath[1/3]: ABANDONMENT: 25 penance. RETRIBUTION: HD = your XL. Spell level = 1 + random_range(XL/5,XL/3) capped at 9. Spells include fire storm/hellfire at 9, LCS at 8, poison arrow/iron shot at 6. XL27? Expect 3d20 hellfire, 8d20 fire storm and 3d48 LCS. All of which ignore your EV/SH.
18:05 <@zackoid> that doesn't sound very friendly.
18:06 < advil> he is the god of magical destruction after all
18:06 < advil> when do I use usk stuff?
18:06 < advil> whenever I can?
18:06 <@zackoid> yeah, you'll go from full piety to 1 star in 5 steps if you're not fighting
18:07 < advil> phew, not monstrous
18:07 <@zackoid> depends on the situation.  early on i usually line pass as soon as i hit **
18:07 <@zackoid> because i need everythig i can get
18:07 <@zackoid> later you can let it go to pain bond or the nuke when needed
18:08 <@zackoid> the biggest problem i had in all my games was building piety when my only damage source was a dagger or short sword of venom
18:08 <@zackoid> so the long sword should smooth that out a lot
18:08 < advil> heh
18:08 < advil> what about stomp?
18:08 <@zackoid> they nerfed poison damage piety gain hard because people were abusing it
18:08 <@zackoid> i only use stomp to finish off weak things mostly
18:09 <@zackoid> rarely it'll do enough damage to make up for the piety cost but not often and i'm guessing never at low invoke
18:10 <@zackoid> *** and **** are crazy strong at higher invoke
18:12 <@zackoid> i think i saw that demonic guardian got buffed recently
18:12 < advil> oh really?
18:12 < advil> it seems very good, but I haven't had it in like 4 years
18:12 < advil> so I'm probably a lot better at using it than I would have been
18:13 <@zackoid> i think it was just like shadow imps instead of crimson
18:13 <@zackoid> but six furies are now 3's also, i don't know if that matters

18:15 <@zackoid> you are playng this all wrong
18:15 <@zackoid> uskayaw is the god of bad decisions
18:16 <@zackoid> you're supposed to run up to mobs and punch them in the nose and then go over and punch their friends in the nose too
18:16 <@zackoid> maybe not d:7 ugly things tho
18:16 < advil> heh
18:16 < advil> now I'm standing next to an ugly thing at xl 8, does that count?
18:17 <@zackoid>  that's better.
18:17 < advil> haha yeah that was all fairly unwise
18:18 <@zackoid> not if you're generating piety quickly
18:18 <@zackoid> fyi the paralyzation is something like max 4 turns
18:18 <@zackoid> at higher invoke
18:18 < advil> well I don't think the line pass was a good move, I should have figured there were other red monsters over there
18:19 <@zackoid> the theme song to this run is shut up and dance

22:47 < advil> does uskayaw work well enough at vaults 5 to rely on his powers?
22:57 <@zackoid> i was waiting for a teleport at that point.  i left the stairs via line pass to get the warden because the rhythm got me, knowing it was a terrible idea
22:58 <@zackoid> i wrecked the welcoming commitee but, at least with my defenses, you can't put out enough damage to take out THAT mass safely

11:51 <@zackoid> whoa: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/e213fbe9c8345be16549d0715d7deb1c3d1282dc
11:52 <@zackoid> not that it wasn't obvious immediately that this would happen.
12:02 < odiv> !!polytheist odiv
12:02 < OCTOTROG> Unwon gods for odiv: Elyvilon, Fedhas, Gozag, Hepliaklqana, Qazlal, Sif Muna, Ukayaw, Uskayaw, Xom, Yredelemnul, Zin
12:02 < odiv> Well, I got my pak win.
12:02 < advil> pak probably doesn't count for polytheist right now
12:04 < odiv> oh, that's true
12:04 < odiv> I think I did get a pak win though.
12:05 < odiv> !hs odiv god=pakellas
12:05 < OCTOTROG> 2. odiv the Grand Gadgeteer (L27 GhAr of Pakellas), escaped with the Orb and 5 runes on 2016-05-20 03:16:40, with 2522096 points after 102883 turns and 9:47:21.
12:05 < odiv> is that how you do it?
12:05 < odiv> oh man, I forgot I had that win
12:05 < odiv> !greatplayer
12:05 < OCTOTROG> Unwon species for odiv: Felid, Formicid, Mummy, Ogre, Spriggan, Tengu
12:06 < odiv> those last three souldn't be too hard.
12:06 < advil> only 2 really hard ones left!
12:06 < odiv> formicid gives me the willies, but you're probably right.
12:07 < advil> just imagine using a bardiche with a large shield
12:07 < odiv> mmm
12:07 < odiv> can they still use 2h launchers and shields?
12:07 < advil> !hs . fo -log
12:07 < OCTOTROG> 16. advil, XL27 FoAK, T:125132: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/advil/morgue-advil-20150615-215520.txt
12:07 < advil> yeah, I was using arbalests too
12:17 < odiv> sweet
12:19 <@zackoid> Fo is probably the easiest on that list
12:20 <@zackoid> at least in terms of win%
12:20 < odiv> I might try that next
12:20 < odiv> !greaterplayer
12:20 < OCTOTROG> Unwon backgrounds for odiv: Arcane Marksman, Skald, Summoner, Venom Mage, Warper
12:20 < odiv> FoAM?
12:20 < odiv> or Sk maybe?
12:20 <@zackoid> --AK is the traditional combo.  all those backgrounds are pretty bad.
12:21 <@zackoid> AM and VM are 'recommended' for Fo
12:22 <@zackoid> wait finesse works on formicids now?
12:25 <@zackoid> !!lg @mgf Fo-- won s=class
12:26 < OCTOTROG> No games for @mgf (Fo-- won).
12:26 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc Fo-- won s=class
12:26 < OCTOTROG> 10 games for @mfc (Fo-- won): 4x Abyssal Knight, 3x Fighter, 2x Artificer, Healer
12:27 < advil> I think Sp is the easiest thing on that list
12:28 <@zackoid> i do not query this as proof against that assertion:

12:31 <@zackoid> heh, things i learn from that chart: centaurs are mostly played by thenoid.  octopodes are unreasonably popular.  nobody likes halflings or ghouls.
12:32 < advil> probably that chart is skewed by challenges as much as anything
12:32 < odiv> I like halflings :)
12:32 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc Ha-- s=name
12:32 < OCTOTROG> 539 games for @mfc (Ha--): 53x kagredon, 51x valrus, 48x ZombieSheep, 36x zackoid, 35x porpoise, 35x odiv, 34x tkappleton, 27x murphyslaw, 25x keeo, 21x sleevener, 21x omnomnOMINOUS, 19x demiurge, 19x Kramin, 18x isthmus, 12x 256, 11x apoch, 8x zeidrich, 8x advil, 6x Hildebrand, 5x TheNoid, 4x laceratedsky, 4x necKro23, 4x ces, 4x slitherrr, 4x Gami, 4x Greynaab, 3x RogerD, 3x

12:33 <@zackoid> ghoul was even a challenge!  except i won that one which is pretty good evidence that nobody participated in it.
12:33 <@zackoid> re: spriggan vs formicid, spriggan are probably 'stronger' but they have that whoops-you're-dead aspect that i think makes it hard to recommend them as such
12:34 < advil> !lg goodplayers fo|sp s=crace / won
12:34 < OCTOTROG> 2187/90641 games for goodplayers (fo || sp): 1300/56777x Spriggan [2.29%], 887/33864x Formicid [2.62%]
12:35 <@zackoid> i would guess relative god choice explains not only that difference but flips it

12:36 < advil> interesting
12:37 < advil> not that that restriction is necessarily still meaningful, it's just looking at accounts that now meet those constraints

12:39 <@zackoid> i was not expecting AK to lead by that much for spriggan.
12:39 <@zackoid> is that people doing abyss dive stunts?
12:39 < advil> AK is popular for Sp

13:28 <@zackoid> also did you guys see that crawl has finally entered it's final, purest form?
13:28 <@zackoid> https://github.com/Dracunos/gnollcrawl
13:38 < odiv> AK gives good escape options and also corruption is (was?) pretty sweet for disrupting branch ends and sneaking out with the rune.
13:38 < odiv> only gnolls?
13:38 <@zackoid> plus AK has an MR-checking instakill.
13:38 < odiv> oooh, right, yeah
13:38 <@zackoid> odiv: dungeon crawl: gnoll soup.
13:39 <@zackoid> http://imgur.com/hH1ddlv
13:40 < odiv> battleaxe should be called gnollslayer.
13:40 <@zackoid> looks like he added fake_lang gnoll to replace butt
14:10 < advil> did corruption change?  it should still be good
14:11 <@zackoid> not that i know of.
14:12 < advil> corrupting vaults 5 is fun
14:12 < advil> also, being able to freely wield distortion weapons (and make one) is great
14:31 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L10 DsWn) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:8) [cbro+]
14:35 < advil> heh a green rat pack gets me enough piety to telefrag apparently
14:39 < advil> line pass is pretty good
14:39 <@shmup> !gamesby hyperadvil
14:40 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil has played 15 games, between 2014-09-18 18:00:22 and 2016-08-16 21:08:46, won 1 (6.7%), high score 1421695, total score 1542364, total turns 200781, play-time/day 0:01:30, total time 17:34:45.
14:43 <@zackoid> it's the best active ability of the 3 for sure
14:43 <@zackoid> telefrag i found to be rarely useful
14:43 < advil> seems like it's good for style points in extended
14:43 <@zackoid> it costs all your piety, moves you out of position and rarely are you fighting something dangerous enough to warrant it and enough popcorn to build all that piety at the same time
14:45 <@zackoid> it's great when it works though
14:45 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L10 DsWn) entered a volcano. (Lair:2) [cbro+]
14:48 < advil> riposte is noticeably better with a high + weapon than the last time I tried it
14:51 < advil> I wonder if I get piety from riposting?
14:51 <@zackoid> no idea, but i think the default assumption is that you would
14:56 < advil> no idea what ranged to go for on this char
14:56 < advil> I guess given my starting int of 22 it should be spells
14:57 < advil> not convinced that's a great idea though
15:10 <@zackoid> who needs ranged when you have zoom zoom
15:12 < advil> it's not a priority
15:12 < advil> but I do usually train at least throwing or evoc on combat characters these days
15:12 <@zackoid> i imagine you won't have 22 int by the time you care about it.
15:13 <@zackoid> yeah i had an iron rod, but i barely used it
15:13 < advil> er, where will my int go?
15:13 <@zackoid> line pass does let you get to things in the back fairly reliably
15:13 < advil> I also have a +7 int armour
15:13 <@zackoid> isn't 7 of it from a crappy leather armour?
15:13 < advil> no, it's 22 without that
15:13 <@zackoid> oh, you're not wearing that.
15:13 < advil> 29 with that
15:14 < advil> it's Wn random stats
15:14 <@zackoid> right, just misread
15:15 <@zackoid> seemed like a normal amount with the +7 included, but there's also 14 other +stat items
15:16 <@zackoid> i often feel like there's never enough XP for everything i want to skill, but then i see things like http://pastebin.com/AgYA69gy
15:16 <@zackoid> 24 in 3 defensive skills, puls 18 xbows, plus 16 weapon, plus 18 evoke
15:17 <@zackoid> and then 19 earth magic, with only sandblast memorized.
15:19 < advil> the earth magic is a nice touch
15:20 < advil> oh I guess I do have some +s on ring/sword

18:12 < odiv> hm
18:12 < odiv> what to acquire
18:12 < odiv> the age old quesiton
18:18 <@zackoid> ??rod acquirement
18:18 < OCTOTROG> staff acquirement[2/2]: If your Evocations is greater than (1d(sum of casting skills) - 4), you get a random rod with an 80% chance. Otherwise, you have a 50% chance to get the enhancer for your best skill if you haven't seen it (if you have, you have a flat 1/3 chance for any staff). Otherwise, you get wizardry, energy, or power, with the first two being twice as likely.
18:18 <@zackoid> i thought they moved rods out of staves
18:18 < odiv> I'll probably just go armour
18:19 <@zackoid> i think the 'right' answer is always wands unless you have haste+hw+tele, boringly
18:19 <@zackoid> ??misc acquirement
18:19 < OCTOTROG> 1/1. https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/acquire.cc#L664
18:19 <@zackoid> with trog i think book acquirement is a guaranteed manual
18:20 <@zackoid> guess i was wrong about rods
18:24 <@zackoid> nope, i was right.
18:24 < odiv> The water nymph is enraged by your magic-hating god!
18:24 < odiv> ha
18:24 <@zackoid>         if (class_wanted == OBJ_MISCELLANY && you.species != SP_FELID)

18:26 <@zackoid> ...ew.
18:27 < odiv> ratskin cloak
18:27 < odiv> :/
18:27 < odiv> I already have an rpois ring
18:27 <@zackoid> that's pretty good for an acquirement
18:27 < odiv> with rC+
18:27 <@zackoid> unless you have a really good cloak
18:27 < odiv> yeah, no it's still worht using
18:27 <@zackoid> not having to swap for rpois is nice.
18:28 < odiv> I lose almost 10% of my AC!
18:28 < odiv> heh

19:12 <@zackoid> i think i quit that one because i was salty that i never found portal projectile and now i have to get a 3rd rune without it
19:14 <@zackoid> huh:  D - the ring "Agalen" {Wiz *Confuse +Inv Str+8}

21:59 < odiv> zackoid: Not very until it kills you? :P
22:00 < odiv> I guess it depends how much confusion would screw you over.
22:00 < odiv> I generally just avoid all those brands
22:00 < odiv> which either means I'm too risk adverse or it's bad design
22:02 <@zackoid> contam isn't bad at all if you have EV
22:03 < odiv> ?
22:03 < odiv> contam/drain is on unequip, isn't it?
22:03 < odiv> or did that change? I haven't been around in a while.

14:44 < odiv> +8AC
14:44 < odiv> and +5 with a ring.

17:48 < advil> that one can go poorly
17:52 < odiv> Yeah, I'm pretty squishy
17:52 < odiv> I shouldn't even be in elf really.
17:53 < odiv> but ever since vaults requires a rune it's tough
17:57 < odiv> so...
17:57 < odiv> hm
17:57 < odiv> what to do
17:57 < odiv> hurl damnation sounds painful, frankly.
17:57 < advil> I had it on a Ds recently and barely used it
17:58 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L18 DsEE) was cast into the Abyss! (a deep elf demonologist) (WizLab) [cbro]

18:01 < odiv> ooh
18:02 < odiv> I did it!
18:02 < odiv> whee
18:04 < odiv> should I use that staff?
18:04 < odiv> It sounds like it hurts.
18:05 < zackoid> i'm not sure what the point of that item is
18:06 < zackoid> if you rely on conjurations it does way too much damage
18:07 < odiv> and you can't swap it, yeah
18:07 < zackoid> it'd be great on VpEn maybe?
18:08 < odiv> eh
18:08 < zackoid> actually now i really want it on a vpen
18:08 < odiv> I guess yeah
18:08 < odiv> but no healing
18:08 < zackoid> no healing?
18:08 < odiv> when you're bloodless
18:09 < zackoid> vamp heals when you're bloodless iirc
18:09 < odiv> oh sure, I was thinking you'd switch away for melee
18:09 < zackoid> but you don't need to be bloodless anyway
18:14 < odiv>  You drop the +3 pair of gloves of Makhleb's Displeasure {-Tele rPois Dex+4
18:14 < odiv> _Stlth+}.
18:14 < odiv> more like odiv's displeasure

22:58 < odiv> probably switch out of this armour at some point to robes.
22:58 < odiv> So I can shatter all the things.
23:04 < zackoid> you have 3 unidentified scrolls
23:04 < zackoid> !
23:04 < odiv> Yeah?
23:04 < odiv> summoning, torment, holy?
23:04 < odiv> or um, I forget hte other one
23:05 < odiv> silence
23:05 < zackoid> just use the ID scrolls on them
23:05 < odiv> nah
23:05 < zackoid> at least for summoning
23:05 < odiv> I have that one inscribed
23:05 < odiv> at least I think it's that.
23:05 < odiv> Maybe it's torment. :P
23:06 < zackoid> those defenses are...something.  especially considering a weapon of protection and a +5AC ring.  but such is the odiv of vehumet way.
23:06 < odiv> What do you mean somthing?
23:06 < odiv> like bad?
23:06 < odiv> also, weapon's not equipped rn
23:06 < zackoid> oh not wielding the trident, nm
23:06 < zackoid> yeah.
23:06 < zackoid> and yeah, bad.
23:06 < odiv> eh, they seem fine?
23:06 < zackoid> 8 dodging skill at xl21???
23:06 < odiv> +8 AC from scales
23:07 < odiv> You know what the best defense is?
23:07 < odiv> :D
23:07 < zackoid> yeah AC isn't terrible thanks to rings and mutations
23:07 < zackoid> but 15 dodging would be practically free at this point.  and 160HP is not good for a Ds
23:08 < zackoid> is there some nasty unique in spider?
23:08 < odiv> Ghost moths
23:08 < odiv> I have no SINv
23:08 < odiv> I should check again.
23:08 < odiv> but I don't think I've found any
23:08 < zackoid> stucky flame?
23:08 < odiv> Seems like I have barely any jewellery actually
23:08 < odiv> Yeah, I have that
23:09 < odiv> but that only works when they're right up on me
23:09 < odiv> and they drain MP from a distance
23:09 < zackoid> 5 pots of invis
23:09 < odiv> yeah, true
23:09 < odiv> It's been a while since I've been there.
23:09 < odiv> and I just finished vaults to 4
23:09 < odiv> So it's depths and Spider
23:10 < zackoid> no MR items at all?
23:11 < odiv> not that I could see
23:11 < odiv> I searched for magic and MR
23:11 < odiv> this robe I'm carrying could be

00:07 < odiv> reluctantly. :P
00:07 < odiv> even though I'm farther away from shatter.
00:08 < odiv> Did find a wizardry ring.
00:11 < odiv> still kinda lacking in gear
00:21 < zackoid> i've never cast shatter.
00:21 < zackoid> level 9 spells are not very useful in a <6 rune game, though i have cast all the rest i think
00:22 < odiv> Orrrr, you speed to the 9 spell and wreck zot with it. :P
00:52 < zackoid> does shatter work vs OOFs?
00:53 < odiv> they're flying, so not very well
00:53 < odiv> iron shot
00:53 < odiv> It takes down draconian packs realy well
00:53 < odiv> and liches, etc
00:53 < odiv> Just walk into a room, shatter 2-3 times.
00:53 < odiv> drop mic

13:49 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[1/5]: Assuming you aren't monstrous, you get five facets, each consisting of three mutations (which usually just stack together). You will get one scales-type facet, one body-slot facet, two tier 2 facets, and one tier 3 facet. 
13:49 < odiv> ???ds mutation rules
13:49 < OCTOTROG> Assuming you aren't monstrous, you get five facets, each consisting of three mutations (which usually just stack together). You will get one scales-type facet, one body-slot facet, two tier 2 facets, and one tier 3 facet.  / The {scales}-type facets are icy blue, iridescent, molten, rough black, rugged brown, slimy green, thin metallic, or yellow scales, or alternatively thin skeletal
13:49 < OCTOTROG> structure, large bone plates, or a repulsion field. Body-slot facets: claws, horns, antennae, hooves, talons. / Tier 2 facets: powered by death, powered by pain, demonic guardian, nightstalker, spiny, rot (rRot, foul stench), fire (flame cloud immunity, rF+, ignite blood), ice (freezing cloud immunity, rC+, icemail), magic shield. / Tier 3 facets: robust (+30% HP), negative energy
13:49 < OCTOTROG> (rN+/rTorment/black mark), {augmentation} (+slay/spellpower scaling with HP), ice (rC+, freezing cloud immunity, passive freeze), fire (rF+, flame cloud immunity, hellfire). Ice/fire facets are incompatible, as are foul stench/ignite blood. / If you are monstrous (1 in 10 chance), then you get 3 body-slot facets but you don't get scales. You still get 2 tier 2 facets and 1 tier 3
13:49 < OCTOTROG> facet, for 6 facets total. Your first body slot mutation will come with the message, "You feel monstrous as your demonic heritage exerts itself."

13:50 < odiv> ??black mark
13:50 < OCTOTROG> black mark[1/2]: Demonspawn mutation gained at level 3 of the negative energy facet. Gives melee attacks that deal damage a 1/5 chance of applying antimagic, weakness or draining to the target. 
13:50 < odiv> ooh
13:50 < odiv> ??black mark[2
13:50 < OCTOTROG> black mark[2/2]: Also a monster spell, from {black sun}s and {Murray}. Any allies in LOS as well as the caster begin absorbing vital energies, and any melee done will, with no rN check, heal said individuals as well as either drain XP, speed, or mp. (This has an antimagic, slowing, or HD drain effect on other monsters). Not that dangerous without the right ally.

16:40 < OCTOTROG> majin-bo[1/3]: +6 Majin-Bo {vamp, Archmagi, MP+6 Int+6}. It's a quarterstaff! Acts as a universal spell enhancer, but costs HP every time you cast a spell: 1 HP per MP spent. (This will never kill you, directly.)

17:03 < odiv> ??rtorment
17:03 < OCTOTROG> torment resistance[1/1]: Each level of rN reduces torment's damage by 10%, so at rN+++ you'll only lose 35% of your HP. In addition, demonspawn can get a torment resistance mutation (50% chance of 0 damage), Kiku gives torment resistance (average protection 60%) at high piety, and Statue Form or being a gargoyle reduces torment damage by half.

17:59 < odiv> two lost souls showed up
18:07 < zackoid> that sounds like a bug
18:07 < zackoid> ??lost soul
18:07 < OCTOTROG> lost soul[1/2]: A crypt monster which tries to stay away from you. If a non-zombie undead dies in its LOS, the lost soul will die instead (fully healing the undead). If a living creature dies, it will become a undead (unrevivable) version of that creature. If other enemies are around, will sometimes ignore the death of low HD creatures.

20:57 < odiv> ah
20:57 < odiv> this is regen, I think, right?
21:02 < zackoid> that makes sense.
21:08 < odiv> anyway, that amulet is awesome

23:23 < odiv> ???shatter
23:23 < OCTOTROG> Level 9 earth spell. Extremely powerful attack which does damage comparable to LCS to all non-flying non-amorphous monsters in LOS radius. Doesn't damage stuff on the other side of walls, but conveniently destroys nearby walls (and potions in 0.13 and earlier) anyway. Prior to 0.15, had a range of (3 + Earth/5). / Deals 1/3x damage to flying and amorphous monsters. 2x damage to
23:23 < OCTOTROG> petrifying, skeletal and brittle monsters (stuff that can be LRD'd, mostly), and 1.5x damage  icy monsters. 4x damage to petrified! Note that it doesn't damage insubstantial monsters at all! Also, petrifying has 2/3 and petrified has 1/2 final damage reduction, so it's more like 4/3x / 2x with AC reduction. / !lg ElderVIII xl=27 pan drcj 1 -tv / !lg xuaxua xl=27 grgl place=pan 1

23:25 < odiv> Yeah, just picked it up
23:25 < odiv> bolt is in a book somewhere.
23:25 < odiv> several places
23:26 < zackoid> i think it is possible that every single blaster that i got the slimy rune with had tornado
23:26 < odiv> heh
23:26 < zackoid> which just eats up TRJ and all his summons
23:26 < zackoid> shatterninja?
23:26 < odiv> Yeah, I'm considering it, but it'd take a while.
23:26 < odiv> I'd mostly be going there for loot, so eh
23:26 < odiv> Not that I really need anything specific.
23:27 < zackoid> this guy got it without tornado: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue//zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20160105-030928.txt
23:27 < zackoid> had pretty good melee though.  i don't remember but based on the spell list probably OOD then tele when TRJ bit it
23:27 < odiv> Nice AC!
23:28 < zackoid> gargoyles are like that.
23:28 < odiv> Yeah.
23:28 < odiv> I'll just come back later or never.

23:28 < odiv> er 4
23:28 < zackoid> if you had a penetrating spell i think 2 LCS and then something to penetrate on the retreat would work
23:29 < odiv> I suppose I could do abyss
23:29 < odiv> I should train some stealth
23:29 < odiv> I have magma
23:29 < zackoid> does that penetrate like fire/cold?
23:29 < odiv> it does have shit AC
23:29 < odiv> yep
23:29 < odiv> it's just less resistable for rF+ dudes
23:29 < odiv> and less damage/range
23:30 < zackoid> for some reason i thought it dropped off faster
23:30 < zackoid> ??bolt of magma
23:30 < OCTOTROG> bolt of magma[1/2]: 55% resistible (by rF) L5 Conj/Fire/Earth bolt spell. Range 5. To-hit: 8+power/25.
23:30 < zackoid> ??bolt of magma[2
23:30 < OCTOTROG> bolt of magma[2/2]: Most likely does more damage than force lance.
23:30 < zackoid> haha
23:31 < odiv> ???bolt of fire
23:31 < OCTOTROG> A level 6 conj/fire penetrating beam attack that can hit multiple opponents in a line for pure fire damage. Does six dice with a maximum of (18 + (power * 2) / 3). At power 50 it does 6d8 damage; at power 100 it does 6d14. As with any fire-based beams, produces steam if it passes over water. To-hit: 10+power/25.

23:31 < odiv> but I have 0 skills in ice. :P

23:32 < odiv> I thought I had a bunch, but that was my last character.

23:36 < odiv> not carts
23:36 < zackoid> iirc i found a staff of power on D:2
23:36 < odiv> nice
23:36 < zackoid> i think the xl25+ magic darts were just to pull stuff
23:36 < odiv> energy is only making a couple things hungerless for me now
23:36 < zackoid> since it's max range, and without vehumet not many spells are
23:36 < odiv> Maybe I should go pick up power again.
23:36 < odiv> or keep my AC dtrident equipped
23:36 < zackoid> power is swappable now, you just lose the bonus
23:37 < odiv> magic dart + battlesphere is a pretty mana efficient way to clear stuff out sometimes.
23:37 < odiv> Yeah, I've been swapping it.
23:37 < zackoid> well not swappable but didn't it used to have some stupid mechanic?
23:37 < odiv> until I got energy.
23:37 < odiv> don't remember.
23:37 < odiv> it didn't stack well with other MP stuff I think for one

23:46 < zackoid> oh that fo.

23:50 < OCTOTROG> A cat race that can't use armour, weapons, rods, or throw anything. They gain {extra lives} as they level up. They have claws (lvl 1: +2 dam), fangs, and fur.

12:43 < odiv> it sucks when it misses.

12:51 < odiv> I think I like earth better as a support school.

14:30 < odiv> haha
14:30 < odiv> oh god
14:30 < odiv> that would be funny
14:30 < odiv> hexes and xbows maybe
14:30 < odiv> so am wouldn't be terrible.
14:31 < odiv> well here goes nothing
14:31 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L1 FoAM) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
14:36 < zackoid> warper does have apportation and portal projectile and passage of golubria which are all pretty good for Fo
14:36 < odiv> Yeah, true. but it's a challenging start even with blink imo
14:37 < zackoid> yeah it's a bad start.
14:37 < odiv> hm
14:37 < odiv> I should have planned this
14:37 < odiv> just go all str all the way? :)
14:38 < odiv> I don't think I'm going to be much of a caster and heavy armour + big fuckoff axe + shield sounds pretty good to me.
14:38 < odiv> thoughts?
14:48 < odiv> Oops, that ring feels deathly cold.
14:48 < odiv> _o - a cursed ring of teleportation (left hand)

15:30 < odiv> chei!
15:30 < odiv> Identified the +10 great mace of the Madman {crush, *Rage rElec rC+++ Int-2} (You found it on level 4 of the Dungeon)
15:30 < odiv> holy fuck
15:31 < odiv> Yeah, that certainly sets the tone
15:36 < zackoid> i did a lot of fo of chei in linesprint.
15:36 < zackoid> it's fun but obviously not very good for winning a particular game.
15:36 < zackoid> better stop training axes!
15:37 < odiv> hm?
15:37 < odiv> why is that?
15:37 < odiv> oh, yeah, that's not me.
15:37 < zackoid> oh right.
15:37 < odiv> that's from the log above.
15:37 < odiv> I wish
15:37 < odiv> was still using it at the end
15:38 < zackoid> does stasis prevent *rage?
15:39 < odiv> stasis itself did
15:39 < odiv> is fo stasis exactly stasis?
15:39 < odiv> ??stasis
15:40 < OCTOTROG> stasis[1/1]: Blocks teleport, blink, haste, slow, berserk, and paralysis. The amulet (removed in 0.18) will give you some (possibly yellow) {contam} and cancel the status if you put it on while hasted or slowed, or while waiting for teleport. Formicids have this as an intrinsic.
15:40 < odiv> Yeah, awesome
15:40 < odiv> ha
16:57 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L6 FoAM) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:4) [cbro+]
16:58 < odiv> oh right
16:58 < odiv> what god?
16:58 < odiv> zackoid: ping
16:58 < odiv> makhleb seems like a bad choice because tele is important when summoning angry demons
16:59 < odiv> !lg * won FoAM s=god
16:59 < OCTOTROG> 29 games for * (won FoAM): 6x Okawaru, 3x Ashenzari, 3x Gozag, 3x Cheibriados, 2x Fedhas, 2x Makhleb, 2x Ru, 2x Xom, Yredelemnul, The Shining One, Trog, Zin, Nemelex Xobeh, Hepliaklqana
16:59 < odiv> gozag?
16:59 < odiv> ???gozag
16:59 < OCTOTROG> The greedy god of gold. Turns corpses into gold, which gives a distraction status that may cause enemies to lose turns. Lets you use {potion petition}, lets you {call merchant}s, and lets you {bribe branch}es. Does not have a normal piety system. / Joining Gozag costs some gold, based on the amount of gold generated in the game so far. On conversion all abilities are available, as long
16:59 < OCTOTROG> as you have enough gold.  / https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:brainstorm:god:propose:gold / <kroki> actually i wanted to try out the money god <kroki> its shit and boring af <kroki> some dev must really love the god /  <Karasu_> So I guess I have to abandon Gozag or else I'll starve / <mibe> you should be able to cancel [potion petition] by abandoning your religion from
16:59 < odiv> I do need a gozag win
16:59 < OCTOTROG> that screen / <Stendarr> b - [D:5] the cursed +0 robe of Gozag's Brutal Revenge {rC+} (163 gold) <Stendarr> so brutal
17:01 < odiv> ???potion petition
17:01 < OCTOTROG> Lets you buy one of three random lists of potion effects, with price depending on the potions offered. The lists can include most good tactical potions. The price of potions does not increase with each use.
17:01 < odiv> ???call merchant
17:01 < OCTOTROG> Pick a shop from a list of four randomly chosen types, and place the shop at your current location. The merchants never ask for more gold than activating call merchant requires, usually significantly less. The quality of the shop contents is based on your XL. / In 0.17-, the shop is placed in an unexplored D/V:1-4/U floor with no previous shops, and the quality of the shop contents is
17:01 < OCTOTROG> better on deeper levels. You get a message when you enter the floor with the shop and you can also check their location on ctrl-o.
17:01 < zackoid> i think they made finesse work on formicids now?
17:02 < odiv> yeah, I think so.
17:02 < odiv> ???finesse
17:02 < OCTOTROG> Heroism (*) temporarily gives +5 to all non-magic skills except Invocations and Evocations, although Fighting skill from it gives no extra HP. Finesse (*****) halves attack delay but does not stack with haste or berserk. Okawaru also gifts weapons, armour, and ammo.
17:02 < zackoid> * Finesse is no longer blocked by stasis.
17:02 < zackoid> is 0.18

17:02 < OCTOTROG> Unwon gods for odiv: Elyvilon, Fedhas, Gozag, Hepliaklqana, Qazlal, Sif Muna, Ukayaw, Uskayaw, Xom, Yredelemnul, Zin
17:03 < zackoid> yred would help with escapes.
17:03 < odiv> hm
17:03 < odiv> I'd probably want to switch to a bardiche
17:04 < zackoid> i've only done gozag with Mu--.  as long as you don't rely on spells that's probably fine too
17:04 < zackoid> hepl was considered really strong but comes with frail 1 now
17:05 < zackoid> i've only done oka and lugonu with fo
17:06 < odiv> I'm on stable, so no hepl
17:06 < odiv> on the plus side, there's pak. :)
17:06 < zackoid> qaz would probably be a bad idea.
17:07 < zackoid> pak was great, but if you're already investing in crossbows not as much
17:07 < odiv> I have like 4 in xbows

17:09 < odiv> shoot xbows past plants
17:09 < odiv> summon shit to run away
17:09 < zackoid> fedhas is strong
17:09 < zackoid> and annoying imo.
17:10 < odiv> fedhas is decent for 3 runes I think
17:10 < zackoid> considered the best early game god iirc
17:11 < odiv> and I do need fedhas for poly
17:11 < odiv> well, we'll see if he's in this temple
17:12 < odiv> nope
17:12 < odiv> no even oka or gozag

17:20 < zackoid> heh vehumet sticks out a lot
17:20 < odiv> How?
17:20 < zackoid> well you can eliminate TSO and jiyva for being late gods.  pakellas and ru have a recency bias.
17:20 < zackoid> no idea what is up with beogh
17:21 < zackoid> maybe just small sample

17:22 < odiv> since my last two were vehumet and trog?

17:23 < odiv> oh, there it is
17:23 < odiv> next to beogh
17:24 < odiv> it's just not letting me mouse over.
17:24 < zackoid> i thought you had a Dg win?
17:24 < odiv> yeah, it's there next to Beogh
17:25 < odiv> it's just a really low % because I have so many games played where I didn't last long enough for a god.
17:26 < zackoid> 0.12%
17:32 < odiv> yes, I realize I die a lot. :(
17:32 < zackoid> everyone does without a god

18:15 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.

18:58 < odiv> Yeah, I don't think enchant gets rid of cursed anymore?
18:58 < odiv> so that ring and dire flail look pretty good right?
18:58 < odiv> That seems like an endgame quality weapon.
18:59 < odiv> ??great mace
18:59 < OCTOTROG> great mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; -4 acc / 17 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). An enormous metal war club, of great cumbrousness. The largest mace most playable races can wield. Ogres and Trolls can wield giant (spiked) clubs too.

18:59 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.

After 40-50 turns, the passage will disappear (making a snapping noise in the process) so be careful if you were relying on it for escape.

10:36 < OCTOTROG> One game for zackoid (cikiller=the_player_character): a kobold (exploding inner flame (29))
14:17 < odiv> the +12 war axe "Waoss" {chop, MR++}
14:20 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L15 FoAM) killed the ghost of mandarbmax the Brawler, a journeyman TrMo of Ru. (D:13) [cbro+]

14:23 < zackoid> odiv: how is foaming?
14:24 < odiv> too easy right now
14:26  * zackoid knocks on wood.
14:28 < zackoid> i wonder if you should use slings instead of crossbows
14:28 < zackoid> actually i'm pretty sure you should, other than greatslings are 1H.
15:08 < odiv> you think?
15:08 < odiv> seems like a waste, but yeah probably right
15:08 < odiv> I'm just waiting for penetration. Is that still a thing?
15:18 < zackoid> odiv: uh not sure, lots of branded ammo got removed
15:18 < zackoid> since you haven't trained much crossbows and you a great greatsling it probably makes sense to use that
15:18 < zackoid> though it'll still be pretty good untrained i'd guess
15:20 < zackoid> ??penetration brand
15:20 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled penetration_brand in my learndb.
15:24 < odiv> ??penetration
15:24 < OCTOTROG> penetration[1/1]: Missiles fired from a launcher of penetration act like bolt spells and can hit several targets. Not unique to crossbows anymore, as javelins may have this brand as well. Also on {piercer} in 0.14+.
15:24 < odiv> Yeah, it's on the launcher now.
15:25 < odiv> and I've got my +12 fuckin' axe

15:25 < odiv> ran across a topor snail and it didn't slow me down.

15:26 < odiv> getting greatsling up a bit wouldn't really hurt anyway
15:26 < zackoid> i think holding out for a penetration crossbow is probably not likely to pay off
15:26 < odiv> yeah, you're right.
15:26 < zackoid> i have no idea what the probabilites are with oka but they can't be big
15:59 < odiv> seems like I always find one
15:59 < odiv> but maybe way later than would be useful.
16:00 < zackoid> i can't recall the last time i even saw one, but i don't use xbows that much
16:02 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L15 FoAM) killed Gastronok. (Lair:3) [cbro+]
16:05 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Maud. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
16:10 < odiv> +8 arbalest as gift, ooh
16:10 < odiv> but I'm already using punk
16:16 < zackoid> heh sorry
16:17 < odiv> nah, that's not amazing
16:17 < odiv> triple arbalest of penetration would be where it's at.
16:17 < zackoid> i never use triple xbows because 26 skill is nutso
16:20 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) became the Champion of Okawaru. (Lair:8) [cbro+]
16:21 < odiv> such a perfectionist.
17:53 < odiv> 491 gold   the ring "Ryson" {Fragile +Fly rPois Dex+7}
17:53 < odiv> I wonder if I should get that.
17:53 < odiv> probably not
17:56 < zackoid> why not?  do you have a better use for money and/or ring slots currently?
17:57 < zackoid> for 500g i would wear that through lair branches easily
17:57 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Harold. (Orc:1) [cbro+]

18:05 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Nergalle. (Orc:2) [cbro+]
18:07 < odiv> and that's orc done
18:09 < odiv> You finish putting on the +1 pair of gloves of Raukkecuwn {rPois Dex+4}
18:10 < zackoid> especially since you're training dodging too, 7 dex is probably wroth a couple EV with such a low base dex
18:12 < odiv> what str do I need for cpa or ice dragon armour?
18:13 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L17 FoAM) killed Urug. (D:14) [cbro+]
18:13 < zackoid> do you mean or gold dragon armour?
18:14 < zackoid> i think CPA is 25ish.  IDA is only like 12ish
18:14 < odiv> oh cool
18:14 < zackoid> i don't think i've ever actually worn CPA outside of sprint
18:14 < zackoid> ??cpa
18:14 < OCTOTROG> crystal plate armour[1/2]: 14AC, 23ER.
18:15 < odiv> k, thanks
18:15 < zackoid> is the trident for hydras?
18:15 < odiv> I guess I'll start going into dex
18:15 < odiv> Yeah it was
18:15 < zackoid> yeah i never take str once i'm into the low 20's.  though with the changes to strweight there might be benefits, not sure
18:16 < zackoid> i probably put too much importance on balancing AC and EV though
18:16 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L17 FoAM) reached level 15 of the Dungeon. (D:15) [cbro+]
18:16 < odiv> you cannot shaft yourself on this level.

11:24 < zackoid> odiv: tengus are like the most vehumet species possible
11:24 < odiv> I got conj,fire, and ice books

11:25 < zackoid> i'm suprised you haven't won one before because of that
11:25 < odiv> probably go air/fire
11:26 < odiv> I kinda want to start streaming crawl.
11:26 < odiv> I should get better first.
11:26 < odiv> and I would either have to play tiles or just have another window open with tiles that I stream. :P
11:26 < zackoid> i never understand streaming crawl because it's pretty bad for that
11:26 < odiv> is it?
11:26 < zackoid> since you have built in streaming and recording but when you use video it's hard to display in a way that is readable
11:27 < odiv> I guess people can just tune in on the web, yeah.
11:27 < odiv> I wonder if anyone ever tries to chat with me.
11:27 < zackoid> if you are going to video cast you should set up a tiles profile specifically for it and spectate your own games, then stream the spectate
11:27 < zackoid> gammafunk has an rc for it, with bigger font and tiles 
11:27 < odiv> ah
11:28 < zackoid> it's weird that they still haven't made it so tileschat is relayed to the console player
11:34 < odiv> I rember reading it in my log after I'd finished a while ago.
11:34 < odiv> but they don't put it in there any more.
11:35 < zackoid> it's an option

11:47 <@shmup> kinda just stream to stream cause your audience is gonna suck anyways
11:47 < odiv> Oh no, I don't think there's an audience for this.
11:47 <@shmup> yeah
11:47 <@shmup> will you talk to streamers?

09:55 <@shmup> wait I am not thinking clearly..
09:55 <@shmup> shorest win is least # of turns
09:55 <@shmup> fastest win is.. least amount of time?
09:55 <@shmup> isn't time directly a function of turns though?
09:55 <@shmup> in this context
09:56 < zackoid> since they have both fastest and shortest i assume that fastest means purely real time
09:56 < zackoid> and time and turncount aren't really related, no

18:59 < zackoid> was that the long one about the monster difficulty?
18:59 < advil> yeah
19:00 < advil> I'm not sure posting that accomplished much, but it got it out of my head
19:00 < zackoid> i especially enjoyed how the one guy illustrated your point when trying to argue something else.
19:00 < advil> and dpeg liked it?
19:00 < zackoid> i don't mind minmay personally, but his status and the way everyone defers to him totally poisons the culture
19:01 < zackoid> it'd be fine if it was jsut the one person like that, but everyone else mimics it
19:01 < advil> I alternate between finding him annoying and ok
19:02 < apoch> how do I figure out how often I die to sigmund?
19:02 < advil> often when people complain about his attitude directly to him he lightens up for a few posts, at least

19:05 < zackoid> but not all starts are equal.  sometims you find a nice dagger.
19:05 < apoch> I'm happy if I get a rune so I play too subobtimaly to worry about win rate
19:05 < advil> can't remember if the count for lm includes deaths
19:05 < zackoid> i don't care about winrate in itself, but i think roguelikes only work if you try and win every game you start.
19:06 < advil> yeah, winrate is a proxy for that
19:06 < advil> also streaking is fun when it works
19:06 < apoch> I hope to win every game I start, but sigmund early gives me a nice boost.

10:36 < zackoid> is that one of those diplomacyalikes?
10:37 <@shrump> it's a 4x game but with a goal of being a lot simpler mechanically. but, control +50% of the stars in the universe and you win
10:37 <@shrump> it does help if you message other Aliens (players) and try to make some deals. you can trade tech with them, ally, fuck over etc.
10:37 <@shrump> I have never played though. this will be my first game
10:38 <@shrump> it will take a few weeks. you won't spend much time in a day spending cred and pointing carriers to claim new stars
10:38 <@shrump> as it might take 8 hours to reach the star you're heading towards

15:10 < zackoid> advil: i have a dumb historical linguistics question if and or when you are up for it.
16:29 < zackoid> advil: also: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/ff52c9bc7241d78ec84204876d2cae7477738c84
16:33 < neckrobama> zackoid: RIP sacrilege
16:33 < neckrobama> meanwhile in nethack, your own god will kill you if you pray too much
16:38 < zackoid> that makes more sense than your god letting some worthless orc have his way with you.
17:29 < advil> good for marvinpa
17:29 < advil> I can try to answer historical linguistics questions but I'm more of an ahistorical linguist
17:40 < zackoid> yeah i know it's not your deal.
17:41 < zackoid> i was just thinking about how it makes sense that when you're talking about languages that divereged from a common ancestor the words that share roots are ones that date to everyday things from the time before they diverged, but i was wondering if anyone had ever tried to prove that.  though maybe thinking about it again it's a tautology.
17:44 < advil> I think when people do language reconstruction it is often high frequency nouns and verbs that they work with
17:46 < zackoid> and sorta relatedly i also wonder if some words resist change more based on their meaning rather than like their complexity
17:48 < zackoid> weird, there are 3 seperate PIE words that eventually became modern words for water?
17:48 < advil> well, I do know that there are common paths for words to change meaning, e.g. 1. meaning X, 2. metaphorical extension of X to meaning Y (e.g. a spatial word gets extended to also have a sense that refers to time, like "on"), 3. word loses meaning X
17:49 < advil> yeah for  really common everyday objects there are more likely to be multiple words
17:50 < advil> for your first question I think what you want is to look at how people calculate the "lexical similarity" of languages
17:51 < advil> I have no idea what the data or method are but this is a neat graph: https://elms.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/lexical-distance-among-languages-of-europe/
17:52 < advil> aha https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list
17:53 < advil> here's an article with a lot of interesting more modern discussion: http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_peterlang_2013c
17:54 < zackoid> glottochronology is a fun word.
17:54 < zackoid> "The Swadesh list was put together by Morris Swadesh on the basis of his intuitions".  SCIENCE!
17:55 < advil> heh yeah that's why those people in that last link start from scratch
17:56 < zackoid> actual physical distance means nothing on that chart, right?  because at first i was suprised how closely Finnish was to the germanic languages, but based on the dotted line it's not close at all.
17:57 < advil> yeah I guess not...not sure I'm very into the line type = degree convention in use there
17:57 < advil> I retract my claim that it's a neat graph
17:57 < zackoid> haha
17:58 < zackoid> poor greek.
17:59 < advil> they seem to have tried to scale the edge lengths by lexical distance, but perhaps overall position in the chart is not as interpretable
18:00 < zackoid> is there a word for languages like croatian-serbian and urdu-hindi that are mostly seperate for political reasons?
18:02 < zackoid> pluricentric maybe.  i need to back out of this wikihole and go home before it's too late.
18:02 < advil> it's more of a concept or a ling 101 aphorism: "a 'language' is a dialect with an army."
18:05 < zackoid> i apologize that all my questions deal with the degenerate form of your discipline.  i'd ask questions about the cool current stuff if i could understand any of it.
18:07 < advil> that's ok, language change is probably objectively more interesting than what I actually do
18:08 < advil> except insofar as it's not interesting because it's impossible due to lack of data and methods for hypothesis testing
18:09 < advil> if we had time machines I'd work on language change instead

Make three copies of the save: orig, temp, fixed. / 2. Play temp.cs, enter wizmode, and move to the appropriate spot with xm (without spending any turns)  3. &( to create the feature, then save. / 4.
22:19 < OCTOTROG> crawl -edit-save temp.cs -get D:14 d14.chunk   4. crawl -edit-save fixed.cs -put D:14 d14.chunk   5. copy fixed.cs and load the copy to verify that the feature is there and you aren't in wizmode.  6. copy fixed.cs back to the server.

17:51 < advil> yeah yeah
17:51 < advil> but polymorph doesn't
18:59 < zackoid> i only used it once but i would definitely use it again if i had 20 long blades
18:59 < zackoid> the log only has two polymorphs recorded, the titan shaped tiamat and the titan shaped royal jelly.

19:35 < zackoid> i looked it up earlier

16:39 < zackoid> Hildebrand: is there more to that cloak?
16:50 < Hildebrand> oh, no, just typo of not closing loop
16:51 < zackoid> 8 strength is pretty good.  rpois is also pretty good.  i would probably use the strength one, then maybe reassess in lair
16:53 < Hildebrand> thats what i was thinking, just, yeah

17:03 < zackoid> wow that was really bad duration
17:04 < apoch> might be a very slight exageration but he wasn't dead when it wore off
17:09 < zackoid> well the important thing is that he died.
17:09 < zackoid> hopefully painfully.

17:42 < zackoid> it should chop heads
17:42 < apoch> it did not
17:43 < zackoid> that is weird.
17:43 < apoch> lair seems tougher
17:43 < zackoid>  16454 | Lair:4   | Noticed an eight-headed hydra
17:43 < zackoid>  16461 | Lair:4   | Killed an 11-headed hydra
17:43 < zackoid> seems like it did?
17:43 < apoch> it had 3 more heads than it started with
17:43 < zackoid> that's what i meant by chopping.
17:43 < apoch> ah
17:44 < apoch> For some reason I thought chop worked like fire
17:44 < apoch> Guess I was wrong
17:44 < zackoid> ah, nope.
21:34 < Hildebrand> nope, chop makes more heads appear
21:34 < Hildebrand> ice sometimes works though
21:34 < apoch> the only true answer is fire
21:37 < Hildebrand> pmuch
21:48 < zackoid> nuh uh, it's LARGE ROCKS
21:50 < OCTOTROG> porpoise (L1 GrEE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
21:50 < apoch> not everyone can throw large rocks
22:32 < zackoid> the actual answer is probably a rod of inaccuracy
22:33 < zackoid> since i think hydrae have 0 evasion.

17:08 <@slitherrr> no, chop makes it even more likely to make heads than usual
17:08 <@slitherrr> i say to the thing from like a day ago
17:11 < apoch> I thought new head chance was basically 100% a hit anyway
17:11 < zackoid> so did i.
17:41 < zackoid> looks like there's a reduced chance if you do very little damage, so by making you do more damage it makes it more likely?  is that what you meant slitherrr?
17:41 <@slitherrr> something like that
17:42 <@slitherrr> i thought it was handled specially but i haven't looked at the code
17:42 < zackoid> if you do 4 or less damage it's only 50% chance of adding heads it looks like

19:59 < zackoid> that's not an actual commit to the main branch, is it?
19:59 < zackoid> i thought that branch was considered a failure
20:25 < advil> I'm pretty sure that's been merged into master
20:25 < advil> it was cherrypicked from that branch
20:26 < advil> the wand still seems to be there
20:26 < advil> as is the potion
20:27 < advil> it was just merged into master a few hours ago (the 2 weeks is the time it was committed to that branch)
20:53 < zackoid> DCSS: all heavy armour all the time
21:05 < advil> I just checked and I've had spell haste on more than half of my wins
21:09 < advil> wand of hasting on 35/46 though
21:13 < advil> heh also it was memorized but not castable on 6 games
21:14 < advil> so spell haste on 20/46
22:29 < zackoid> advil: how many of those was it important for, though?
22:29 < zackoid> i actually think haste is overrated for <6 runes.  i just hate how there's almost no reasons left to ever cast spells unless you're blasting, and even that is not a good idea
22:32 < zackoid> the only times i recall haste being essential was for some spen type games, though it was really important for them
22:36 < odiv> it's fun on summoners!
22:36 < odiv> and makhleb followers
22:36 < odiv> here's a demon!
22:36 < odiv> Now it's hasted!

23:03 < OCTOTROG> boots of running[1/1]: -1 to movement delay (default is 10 for most races). Stacks with Swiftness. In 0.12 and older gave -2 delay.

23:11 < advil> I guess the muts got out of hand
23:12 < advil> they end up not so bad, just frail 1 is the only bad thing
23:12 < zackoid> but he had 2 cure mutes, and doing all that to end up with frail makes no sense
23:13 < advil> I was assuming that after all the shining eyes they were so bad that rolling the dice a few times seemed like a good idea?  didn't read the actual sequence of muts carefully
23:15 < zackoid> i wonder if some of those shines were intentional?  you can have bad luck with them but that seems like a lot
23:15 < zackoid> no ranged attack to speak of probably hurt
23:16 < advil> yeah that's what I was thinking

23:24 < odiv> advil: Yeah, I told him to maybe train and use a war axe for now and keep the exec axe in mind if he needs an xp dump later.
23:24 < odiv> also I don't know if I've ever read the tavern.
23:24 < odiv> I've rpobably been directed to a thread or two ages ago.

19:16 < advil> feature freeze yesterday, so I guess the tournament is coming up too
19:48 < zackoid> i ain't feelin' it.
20:56 < johnstein> zackoid: why is that trj change significantly more dangerous?
20:57 < johnstein> just that after killing trj you have to deal with getting surrounded?
21:06 < advil> I guess there's also now incentive to fight trj in the open, so that all the remaining jellies after he does don't immediately eat everything
21:06 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L1 HEWr) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]

21:20 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L7 HEWr) killed Duvessa. (D:4) [cbro+]
21:52 < zackoid> yeah, because you can't rely on the walls to limit number of adjacents after TRJ dies
21:52 < zackoid> if it'll make advil happy pretend i said "for formicids"
21:56 < zackoid> but the most dangerous things are usually acid blobs anyway
21:58 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L9 HEWr) killed Crazy Yiuf. (D:7) [cbro+]

02:54 < johnstein> it's full and apparently no one else has access to the server to rsync ttyrecs

11:20 <@shmup> surprised it's that poorly managed
11:21 <@shmup> they are v organized from a software standpoint
11:23 < zackoid> isn't it pretty common for devs to be really bad at IT?

12:03 <@shmup> yeah sure zackoid, like anything, there are going to be more people bad at a thing than good at a thing
12:04 <@shmup> but most people i'm friends with care about devops at least a little bit 
12:04 <@shmup> if youre gonna run a crawl server it'd be nice to know how to scale it up during tourneys. i understand that is $$ though and why they probably dont 
12:06 <@shmup> on my list of things id like to do and make as painless is possible might be running a crawl server that scales during moments needed and also is as cheap as possible w/ todays options
12:06 <@shmup> you know, instead of actually playing :)

19:10 < lukano> fyi I will be taking part in the nov 4th tourney, so please to be throwing me in a team somewhere :)
19:11 < lukano> and letting me know which one
--- Day changed Sat Oct 29 2016
11:30 < advil> hmm I guess someone should start a tournament thread
11:30 < advil> I'm going to be so absent for this tournament I'm not the right person :-/
13:36 < lukano> anyone kno what' sneeded to get HilariousDeathArtist's rc working in .19?  the include += HilariousDeathArtist.rc
13:36 < lukano> was working when .19 was in trunk, but since moving to tourney prep its not
13:59 < advil> not sure, what happens when you try to include it?
14:16 < advil> actually I wonder if it could be as simple as, the account just hasn't been updated to have the file for 0.19
14:16 < advil> assuming .rc files aren't automatically updated, which they usually aren't
14:20 < advil> yeah, if you're playing on cbro at least, that file doesn't exist yet
14:59 < sgun_> craaaawl
16:30 < lukano> advil: ah ok.  hope it gets populated out to other servers soon then :)
16:53 < lukano> oh I guess CAO hasn't pushed .19 off of trunk yet, so until that happens the rc won't have anywhere to sync up to
16:55 < lukano> oh and the guy actually plays on cszo, which I assume is having issues?
16:55 < lukano> er, or isnt hosting games at all anymore.  didnt know that :P
16:58 < zackoid> you should be able to copy everything off the github version
17:02 < lukano> yeah, I just did that
17:02 < lukano> had to copy and include all the nested rc's as well
17:02 < lukano> but dumping them all in the .rc, above the actual HDA.rc worked just fine as far as I can tell
17:02 < lukano> messy, but works :P
17:08 < lukano> bot not announcing?
17:30 < advil> CSZO has been dead for a little bit
17:30 < advil> I did read that CAO was having some disk problems lately, so that might be part of it
17:31 < advil> the bot announcements may have changed depending on the server?  not sure
17:31 < advil> CBRO should announce though
17:31 < advil> !lm .
17:31 < advil> or maybe OCTOTROG is taking a nap
17:31 < OCTOTROG> 6594. [2016-07-26 20:12:27] advil the Martial Artist (L14 TrHu of Jiyva) left the Swamp on turn 28363. (Swamp:1)

13:23 < advil> hmm, so, anyone interested in running the organizing thread?
13:23 < advil> I'm willing to start the MFC thread if no one else does it, with the caveat that I'll be kind of out of the loop for the first week and a half of the tournament
13:24 < advil> I should be paying enough attention to be able to sort out team assignments I guess, though maybe a 2nd would be helpful

13:11 < kimtrucks> hello
13:27 < lukano> hey kim
13:30 < kimtrucks> so is there a guide I can read?
13:32 < roj> The getting started on the wiki was pretty good for me but I have an extensive-ass nethack background.
13:32 < roj> Let me dig out a link.
13:33 < roj> Are you playing for the first time thie tourney?
13:33 < roj> If so, woo.
13:33 < roj> (if not, woo too)
13:35 < kimtrucks> first time this tourney, yup
13:35 < roj> Neat!
13:35 < roj> Uhm.
13:37 < roj> Thhere it is!
13:37 < roj> http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Beef_Jerky%27s_Simple_3_Rune_Minotaur_Berserker_Guide_for_Beginners
13:37 < roj> This character guide goes over actual commands and things.
13:37 < kimtrucks> thanks, emailing to myself for later reading
13:37 < roj> Go ahead and let regerences to gods flow right out your ears.
13:37 < zackoid> lemme check that guide to see if it's nonsense
13:38 < zackoid> much of the wiki is, unfortunately, because the devs and good players mostly shun it
13:38 < roj> They're like a second layer of class abilities, the god you pick, and they don't REALLLLY come up until a little later.
13:38 < roj> Ha, true. I welcome your second opinion.
13:38 < zackoid> there are some good guides in the DCSS threats on MFC, but there are like 30 DCSS threads so i might have to dig for awhile
13:38 < roj> This was bookmarked in my deepet folder.
13:38 < roj> Right next to alt.binaries.other.minotaur.sources
13:38 < zackoid> also DCSS changes so much with every version it's really hard to keep long-form guides up to date
13:39 < zackoid> "q: I don't know what quaff means but it makes you drink potions "
13:39 < zackoid> hopes are soaring!
13:39 < roj> Heh.
13:40 < roj> They told be to brandish then quaff a tincture so I quit and joined the volleyball team.
13:41 < roj> Yeah, on restrospect, this is till doing a forkload of assuming.
13:41 < kimtrucks> I've played GUI roguelikes a bunch
13:41 < kimtrucks> so I'm familiar with quaffing
13:41 < kimtrucks> sorry
13:42 < kimtrucks> I guess I should phrase it as "roguelikes with actual graphics" lest someone argue that hack has a GUI because it does show you things in a 2D plane
13:42 < zackoid> i haven't read 90% of it but it mostly looks ok.  there is some stuff that is out of date and some stuff that is misguded but if you've literally never played before it at least has some reasoning about things.  
13:42 < lukano> I dont think this # subscribes to that level of neckbeardery
13:43 < zackoid> i like that it includes the tiles for some dangerous enemies, but i didn't read any of that part because it's super long
13:43 < lukano> to nitpick the gui definition, that is :P
13:43 < zackoid> kimtrucks: for the record crawls has tiles and you should use them, specifically webtiles for the tournament.  
13:44 < lukano> agreed.  crawl tiles is the best way to play
13:44 < lukano> *web-tiles
13:45 < roj> Heck yeah.
13:45 < kimtrucks> so the most rogue-like roguelike I've played is probably Dredmor
13:45 < roj> I think you'll be fine with a few roguelikes under your belt, then.
13:45 < kimtrucks> or one of the other related ones
13:46 < roj> Yeah, a lot maps. The controls might be confusing, but the in-game help is pretty straightforward.
13:46 < lukano> here's my advice to new players ; use webtiles, try a melee class (minotaur berserker for exaple) to start, be sure to check your skill pane (a) and effects (shift-a) lists at times, and always kite enemies back to the up stairs as only the closest tiles can follow you back up
13:46 < zackoid> here's slitherrr's guide, also pretty old already: http://pastebin.com/c3fR1EzR
13:46 < lukano> or as with all roguelikes, if you can't go back up, find a hallway to minimize angles of attack
13:46 < kimtrucks> thanks guys!
13:47 < zackoid> people usually are happy to watch and give pointers because it's impossible to learn via infodump.  but the dump will help you get the first 20 deaths out of the way.
13:48 < lukano> the crawl wiki si a handy reference but as mentioned not always up to date
13:50 < zackoid> kimtrucks: there's also an in-game tutorial that you might want to run through even before reading just to get a frame of reference for the map
13:54 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L18 MiBe) found a barnacled rune of Zot. (Shoals:4) [cbro]

15:13 < odiv> and off painkillers already.
15:39 <@slitherrr> huh, no more salamander stormcallers, i wonder why
15:39 <@slitherrr> i wonder how long until we completely forget about maud
15:41 < odiv> Maybe fire storm is going?
15:42 < odiv> I hope not
15:42 <@slitherrr> haste is gone!!
15:44 <@slitherrr> i'm so sad, that's the centerpiece of the ogam death build
15:44 <@slitherrr> well that and the enormous club
15:49 < odiv> I know.
15:49 < odiv> I told johnstein he should threaten to shut down cbro until they put it back in.
16:04 < kimtrucks> odiv I'm glad it went well!
16:22 < kimtrucks> how's she feeling?
17:25 < odiv> She's feeling well.
17:38 < zackoid> i feel like there's less and less reason to ever not wear plate the entire game now

18:35 < Kimtruck> for some reason the ? menu wasn't letting me page down/up
18:35 < advil> that sounds annoying
18:35 < advil> are you playing tiles?
18:35 < Kimtruck> yup, on johnstein's server
18:36 < Kimtruck> I blame the tutorial somehow
18:37 < advil> + and - should work for scrolling up and down on the key reference screen even if page up/down aren't for some reason

20:23 < OCTOTROG> chain mail[1/2]: 8AC, 15ER.
20:23 < Hildebrand> ??scale mail
20:23 < OCTOTROG> scale mail[1/1]: 6AC, 10 ER.
20:28 < Hildebrand> ??axes
20:28 < OCTOTROG> axes[1/1]: (acc,dam,delay,mindelay) [hands]: hand axe (+3/7/1.3/0.6), war axe (+0/11/1.5/0.7), broad axe (-2/13/1.6/0.7), battleaxe (-4/15/1.7/0.7) [2], executioner's axe (-6/18/2.0/0.7) [2]. All axes {cleave} and chop hydra heads.
20:31 < Kimtruck> is a battleaxe better than a +2 venomous hand axe? I assume so, but
20:31 <@ZureaL> Kimtruck, it depends on what your training level in axes is
20:31 < advil> it probably is, but the tradeoff is weapon speed
20:31 < Kimtruck> 10.8
20:32 <@ZureaL> if you hit '@', it'll show you what your attack speed is when wielding
20:32 < Kimtruck> of course attack speed is a thing
20:32 < advil> I'd use a battleaxe over a hand axe at that skill level
20:32 < advil> unless it was an electric hand axe or something
20:32 <@ZureaL> yea, I'd probably focus trainning on nothing but axes too
20:33 < advil> crawl has so many misc details...it's a bit absurd really
20:33 < advil> why did I fill my brain up with this stuff
20:33 <@ZureaL> hahah...amen advil 
20:35 < advil> I wonder if this is one of those rounds where putting thenoid on the cbros team would be a better bet for competitive
20:35 <@ZureaL> well if none of the other cbro's are going to play, just put johnstein and greynaab on the compet team
20:35 < advil> although the bros seem to not be so into this tournament either
20:35 < advil> ah right
20:36 < advil> shouldn't zackoid be on competitive?
20:36 < advil> !lg t0.18 won s=name
20:36 < OCTOTROG> One game for advil (t0.18 won): advil
20:36 < advil> !lg@mfc  t0.18 won s=name
20:36 < advil> ugh
20:36 < advil> !lg @mfc  t0.18 won s=name
20:36 < OCTOTROG> 25 games for @mfc (t0.18 won): 5x zackoid, 5x TheNoid, 3x odiv, 3x Almightybob, 2x sleevener, 2x staplegun, JerBear56, greynaab, porpoise, advil, isthmus
20:36 < Kimtruck> well it's now a +1 battleaxe to boot
20:36 < advil> he's definitely competitive by that metric
20:37 <@ZureaL> advil, he wasn't sure if he was going to actually feel like playing
20:37 < advil> ah
20:37 < advil> well I'm not sure if I actually can play :)
20:38 < advil> I bet once he starts playing he will keep going
20:39 < advil> I'm traveling to europe sunday and then back the sunday after, plus this first weekend is shot :-/
20:40 < zackoid> but there are witchers to witch
20:40 < johnstein> I think jer and Jacob might play
20:40 < johnstein> and maybe zombie
20:40 < johnstein> so we could have 5
20:40 < johnstein> I just haven't had any time to do any coordination
20:41 < johnstein> people keep trying to say we are the competitive team. we really aren't
20:41 < johnstein> we just got stuck with being the de facto competitive team since everyone else insisted on being casual or semi-casual
20:42 < johnstein> personally I think most of us are about semi-competitive/casual. cept for a few obvious aces. heh
20:42 < advil> well you guys always have like 4-6 wins as a baseline, and if you add thenoid to that it could be a lot
20:42 < zackoid> i would be more interested in playing if runes 6-15 didn't exist.
20:43 <@ZureaL> I've never had a win of more than 5 runes
20:43 < Kimtruck> hungry ghosts can go straight to hell. not dead.
20:44 < advil> they're a bit annoying
20:44 < advil> they're sort of a lesson in: try walking away from things that aren't yet next to you
20:45 < johnstein> advil: zombie and Jacob (bob) always do really well.  I usually don't have time to play
20:46 < johnstein> but really my point was, I don't think we need to necessarily consider cbros competitive, but we can certainly fill the niche if needed. I will have more info tomorrow after I harass the bros
20:48 < zackoid> it's this week already, right?
20:48 < zackoid> jeez
20:51 < Kimtruck> survived my first catoblepas
20:57 < Kimtruck> Killed Erica
20:59 < Kimtruck> .goog orcish mines
20:59 < Kimtruck> ah wrong channel
21:00 < Kimtruck> ??orcish mines
21:00 < OCTOTROG> orcish mines[1/6]: Found in the main dungeon, between D:9 and D:12. Two levels deep.
21:00 < Hildebrand> usually you wait on mines
21:00 < Hildebrand> think its like you go to d10, lair, mines
21:01 < Hildebrand> TheNoid, here to school us all
21:02 < Kimtruck> believe I am about to be killed by a bee bodybuard
21:02 < TheNoid> I'm mostly just here to sit around and do nothing.
21:03 < TheNoid> Bees are pretty much the worst.
21:03 < advil> bees suck
21:03 < advil> only shrikes are worse, and they are really just bees
21:03 < Kimtruck> nope from 3hp to 25 again
21:04 < Kimtruck> goddamn it teleported out of royal jelly chamber during a rest
21:05 < Kimtruck> well that wasn't that bad
21:05 < Kimtruck> no idea what pulled me out but neither of the baddies looked like spellcasters
21:06 < Kimtruck> ok am I wearing some sort of joke teleportation gear? 
21:07 < johnstein> ring of tele?
21:07 < johnstein> % I think
21:07 < johnstein> look for *tele
21:08 < johnstein> * means random.

21:17 < zackoid> !!lg Kimtruck s=xl
21:18 < OCTOTROG> One game for Kimtruck: 12
21:18 < zackoid> d:12 on your first ever game is pretty far.
21:20 < Kimtruck> my two luckiest breaks: a +2 handaxe of venom before I even got into dungeon
21:20 < Kimtruck> and randomly reading a fear scroll when I was surrounded by Prince Ribbit and, err, Other Named Dude that somehow led to them both dying
21:24 < Kimtruck> thanks to Hildebrand for lots of help!
21:35 < lukano> d12 on first game is probably 3x as deep as I did on my first game
21:40 < Hildebrand> shmup, want someone to post that on the forums for you too?
21:40 < Hildebrand> also, how cometative/casual?
21:41 < Kimtruck> lukano well I had Hildebrand teaching me how to train skills and such
21:49 < Kimtruck> oh god Natasha's a 9 lives pun, isn't she
21:50 < Kimtruck> ??natasha
21:50 < OCTOTROG> natasha[1/4]: A felid unique. Comes back to life after she dies, losing 1 HD and 5 max hp each time.
21:50 < Kimtruck> _Mordus's ghost (amateur Tengu Fire Elementalist) comes into view. It is wielding a weapon of electrocution.
21:51 < Kimtruck> uhhh that sounds deeply bad
21:51 < Kimtruck> I've turned myself into a tree

21:53 < Hildebrand> Kimtruck, 
21:53 < Kimtruck> yeah I was depseration-quaffing under the idea that cure potions are likely to be found in higher quantities
21:54 < Kimtruck> it actually saved me since I had just put on Trog's Hand and the adders couldn't damage me as a tree
21:56 < Kimtruck> ok off to bed after dying to a named baddie
21:56 < Kimtruck> thanks again for the help
22:47 < odiv> you also get rpois in tree form

07:53 < OCTOTROG> mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 8 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A short club with a metal head.
07:55 < Kimtruck> ??armour
07:55 < OCTOTROG> armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.
07:56 < Kimtruck> just found a vampiric whip for my maces character
07:58 < Kimtruck> the cursed +0 whip of a volcano (weapon) {vamp, Fragile rC- rN++ Int+10}
08:03 < Kimtruck> and dead on d:5 to some Beogh-worshipping mage
08:07 < Kimtruck> amulet of guardian spirit on my beserker, yeah
08:40 <@laceratedsky> ??steam dragon scales
08:40 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled steam_dragon_scales in my learndb.
08:44 < zackoid> that's odd.
08:44 < zackoid> laceratedsky: scales are the same as dragon armour used to be
08:44 < zackoid> they just renamed it, and you no longer need that first enchant scrolls
08:44 < zackoid> ??sda
08:44 < OCTOTROG> sda[1/1]: see {steam dragon armour}, {swamp dragon armour}, {storm dragon armour} or {shadow dragon armour}
08:45 < zackoid> ??steam dragon armour
08:45 < OCTOTROG> steam dragon armour[1/1]: 5AC, 0ER, rSteam. Can be created by enchanting a steam dragon hide.
08:45 < zackoid> that's just out of date.
08:47 <@laceratedsky> cool, thank you
08:47 <@laceratedsky> and also, when the fuck did hydras start showing up on D9?
08:48 < zackoid> they always have, just rarely
08:49 < OCTOTROG> laceratedsky the Cleaver (L10 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, mangled by a white ugly thing on D:8, with 6289 points after 7972 turns and 0:34:42. [cbro]
08:49 <@laceratedsky> damnit!
08:52 < zackoid> RIP ('d to shreds)
09:29 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) entered the Vestibule of Hell. (Depths:1) [cbro]
09:31 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) killed Geryon. (Hell) [cbro]
09:31 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Basher (L10 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, blasted by an electric eel (bolt of electricity) on D:8, with 5439 points after 7014 turns and 0:31:50. [cbro]

09:33 < zackoid> oh wait nevermind.  i was thinking of shock serpents
09:35 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) entered the Realm of Zot. (Depths:5) [cbro]
09:53 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) reached level 5 of the Realm of Zot. (Zot:5) [cbro]
10:02 < Kimtruck> ??amulet of faith
10:02 < OCTOTROG> amulet of faith[1/2]: Piety increases one quarter faster. Yes, this means you get more gifts. Ru offers sacrifices more quickly; Xom has more dynamic piety and acts more often; no effect with Gozag. Removing the amulet reduces your piety by 1/3.
10:04 < zackoid> it is very good.  especially if you already put it on.
10:06 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) found the Orb of Zot! (Zot:5) [cbro]
10:06 < OCTOTROG> Watch lukano at: http://crawl.berotato.org:8080/#watch-lukano [cbro]
10:13 < lukano> ding ding
10:13 < OCTOTROG> lukano the Conqueror (L27 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, escaped with the Orb and 4 runes, with 2067146 points after 98089 turns and 5:34:33. [cbro]
10:15 < lukano> probably could have grabbed at least the abyssal rune and the icy rune, ontop of what I had... but figured I'd cash in the win rather than get greedy
10:15 < lukano> the last 4 or 5 end game runs have died due to greed :)
10:19 < zackoid> why icy?
10:20 < lukano> i had rc+++, reflect, flying, and demon whip of fire -- so I figured I'd stand a reasonable chance
10:20 < lukano> plus the high ac and str 
10:21 < lukano> that said I've never done that branch before so I may be wrong :)
10:21 < Kimtruck> so was the refc to turn off or reprioritize main weapon training at level 16?
10:22 < zackoid> it depends on the weapon.
10:22 < zackoid> ^dump Kimtruck

10:24 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
10:24 < zackoid> that's what it shows for me, must be cached
10:24 < roj> feature request: 'itsnotyouitsme' alias for dump
10:25 < zackoid> so for a flail you don't want to train much past 14
10:25 < zackoid> but soon you'll find a bigger mace
10:25 < roj> ...
10:25 < roj> Why/
10:25 < roj> For cross skill bonues for superior weapon classes?
10:25 < zackoid> i would stop focusing maces but keep training them to 20.  you want a great mace eventually.
10:25 < zackoid> roj: why stop training at 14?
10:26 < roj> Yes, that is the question, zackatio.
10:26 < zackoid> because at that skill you are swining it as fast as is possible, and further investments have very small returns on your damage output.
10:27 < zackoid> swinging.
10:27 < roj> Ah, okay.
10:28 < zackoid> i comissioned this from shmup:
10:28 < zackoid> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/dcss-weapons.txt
10:28 < zackoid> though it is wrong in a few places, it is less wrong than the version on the wiki 
10:30 < Kimtruck> thanks guys!
10:30 < roj> MefightClub: Less wrong than the wiki.
10:31 < Kimtruck> at what point does enchanted armor of one type become less useful than unenchanted armor of next level up?
10:31 < Kimtruck> specficially +2 fire resistant chain vs normal plate
10:31 < Kimtruck> ??lair
10:31 < OCTOTROG> lair[1/2]: Accessed from the main dungeon somewhere between levels 8 and 11. Six levels deep (eight in 0.18-). The lair is full of "natural" critters such as rats, snakes, and yaks. One of Swamp/Shoals and one of Snake/Spider appears there, as well as Slime, and there is a relatively hard vault on Lair:8. The petting zoo of Crawl, if petting zoos had hydras.
10:31 < zackoid> Kimtruck: for armour i usually just put it on and compare AC+EV, taking the higher.
10:32 < zackoid> the resists have value, of course, if it's close
10:32 < Kimtruck> ??AC
10:32 < OCTOTROG> armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.
10:32 < Kimtruck> ??EV
10:33 < OCTOTROG> ev[1/5]: Shorthand for evasion (the stat). It is improved by Dodging skill, equipment with evasion bonuses, and the repulsion field mutation; it is worsened by equipment with evasion penalties.
10:33 < zackoid> they should be shown in the top right
10:34 < Kimtruck> oh I just wanted to know what exactly they did
10:34 < Kimtruck> since it was +1 to AC, -1 to EV
10:34 < Kimtruck> to switch to plate
10:35 < zackoid> in that case i would wear the chain
10:35 < zackoid> as i'm sure you figured out
10:36 < Kimtruck> ??slay
10:36 < OCTOTROG> slay ~ slaying[1/3]: Works like weapon {enchantment}. Magic is unaffected.
10:37 < Kimtruck> ok this drops my AC by 1 compared to fire resistance, but it's a named +3 Slay chainmail
10:38 < Kimtruck> so... I'll do that
10:39 < zackoid> slay is very good, so probably the right choice.  having said that you'll now run into a nasty fire-branded enemy
10:42 < Kimtruck> I'm a tree again as I try to aovid dying. sigh. 
10:43 < roj> Which will also not work against fire.
10:43 < roj> IIRC 'i'm a tree' is pretty powerful.
10:43 < roj> So really, you're winning!
10:44 < Kimtruck> ??snake pit
10:44 < OCTOTROG> snake pit[1/3]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere between levels 3 and 6. Four levels deep. The serpentine rune lies at the bottom, and the greater nagas are renowned for their charm and hospitality. Half of all games contain this branch; the others contain {Spider Nest}.
10:48 < Kimtruck> ??shoals
10:48 < OCTOTROG> shoals[1/4]: Lair branch that can replace Swamp. It has tides, merfolk (including javelineers and aquamancers), {kraken}, snapping turtles, sea snakes, cyclopes, and harpies. It is 4 levels deep and has the barnacled rune at the end.
10:53 < Kimtruck> ??fan of gales
10:53 < OCTOTROG> fan of gales[1/1]: The air {elemental evoker}: causes a burst of wind which throws back nearby monsters and clouds. Does not affect clouds on your own square.
10:55 < Kimtruck> a lovely god gift in a weapon type I don't use
10:55 < Kimtruck> ??executioner
10:55 < OCTOTROG> executioner[1/2]: Completely unlike ogres for the end game - cannot be outrun without controlled magical translocations, hits for up to 150 damage per turn of yours, sees invisible, and resists elemental magic. Fortunately it's not too hard to kill and can't fly. And with 9 hits to spread damage over, high-AC chars are in little danger.
10:56 < Kimtruck> ??executioner's axe
10:56 < OCTOTROG> executioner's axe[1/2]: (axes; -6 acc / 18 dam / 2.0 base delay / 0.7 min delay at 26 skill; two handed). You want axes? You want them big? You want to swing your axe into the guts of demons? Do the demons have HUGE GUTS you want to RIP AND TEAR? Then this axe is for you.
10:57 < roj> I'm not, generally speaking, a fan of gales.
10:58 < roj> Uncle Henry ALONE. Man up and parent, man. You have 3 farm hands freeing up your time.
11:07 < Kimtruck> ??slime pits
11:07 < OCTOTROG> slime pits[1/2]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere on levels 5 or 6 (on Lair:6-8 in 0.18-). Five levels deep (six in 0.18-), with a rune in the loot vault at the bottom, surrounded by stone (vulnerable to LRD/shatter but not passwall/digging) walls. Killing the royal jelly turns the walls into diggable glass. The {slime wall}s hurt to touch!
11:08 < Kimtruck> ??antimagic
11:08 < OCTOTROG> antimagic[1/2]: A weapon brand which makes monsters sometimes lose a turn when they try to cast spells. Wielding it reduces max mp by 2/3, getting hit by it depletes mp. Works on everything that has non-divine spells, including demons, orbs of fire, electric golems, etc.
11:10 < Kimtruck> ??ice
11:10 < OCTOTROG> book of ice[1/1]: Ice Form (in 0.16+), Metabolic Englaciation, Ozocubu's Refrigeration, Bolt of Cold, Freezing Cloud, Simulacrum
11:13 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Bludgeoner (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by a six-headed hydra on Lair:6, with 37202 points after 15266 turns and 1:16:24. [cbro]
11:14 < roj> hydras, man.
11:15 < Kimtruck> the hydras haven't been giving me problems

11:37 < zackoid> ??tree form
11:37 < OCTOTROG> tree form[1/3]: Immobile form with -Tele, +50% HP, 20 + XL/2 AC, minimal EV, rN+++, rPois, torment immunity, and gives +12 base UC damage. Unlike statue form, tree form does NOT give rot or poison immunity.
11:37 < zackoid> i almost never use that, though it is good in the very early game.  your defenses were probably better without it, plus you could move and teleport away.
11:38 < Kimtruck> but hey
11:38 < Kimtruck> I got to lair on my whateverth game
11:39 < Kimtruck> I'm happy about that
11:39 < zackoid> the bottom of lair, even
11:39 < Kimtruck> basically I was hoping tree form would kill the poison
11:39 < Kimtruck> as I can see now... it doesn't
11:41 < zackoid> 0 potions of curing is odd, did you already use a bunch?
11:42 < zackoid> ^help
11:43 < Kimtruck> I picked up 1 potion of curing all game
11:44 < Kimtruck> and 1 or 2 of healing
11:46 < zackoid> that's rare, usually curing is by far the most common\
12:08 < Kimtruck> ??ring of fire
12:08 < OCTOTROG> ring of fire[1/1]: A ring of fire (jewellery) acts as a positive fire enhancer and gives rF+ rC-. Not to be confused with {ring of flames}, a spell. In 0.18- also give a negative ice enhancer.

12:12 < OCTOTROG> xl[1/1]: Affects hp, mp, mr, stats, spell levels, and the highest level of spells you can cast. And chance to resist various effects such as mephitic cloud confusion.
12:13 < Kimtruck> ??SH
12:13 < OCTOTROG> shield[1/5]: Wearing a shield gives you a chance to block all damage from some attacks, including arrows, melee, and some spells. Shields prevent off-hand attacks, and until you have enough skill they also slow your melee attacks and make it harder to cast spells.
12:14 < Kimtruck> ??dire flail
12:14 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.
12:14 < Kimtruck> is there any way to compare my damage output directly?
12:14 < Kimtruck> ??protection
12:14 < OCTOTROG> protection[1/1]: Bonus AC. On rings, anywhere from -6 to +6. On weapons, gives +7 AC for up to 5 turns when you successfully hit a monster that isn't {firewood}. In 0.18- gave +5 AC always when wielded. On shields, +3 AC. You could also have learned any of this by viewing the in-game item description.
12:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> ummm, i don't know of one
12:17 < zackoid> Kimtruck: not easily.
12:17 < Kimtruck> ??flail
12:17 < OCTOTROG> flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; +0 acc / 10 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A mace with a short chain connecting the head to the haft.
12:17 < zackoid> between two weapons, you mean?
12:17 < Kimtruck> yeah
12:18 < Kimtruck> I got a +2 flail of protection and an unenchanted dire flail. the 'of protection' makes me really inclined to keep the non-dire flail
12:18 < omnomnOMINOUS> seems reasonable for now
12:18 < Kimtruck> ??crude
12:18 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled crude in my learndb.
12:19 < omnomnOMINOUS> crude means it's an artifact
12:19 < zackoid> yeah i would, for now, but that flail is a pretty bad weapon in the long run.
12:20 < zackoid> the way combat works in DCSS is extremely complicated, and the only accurate way to compare weapons is using the simulator in wizard mode, but that is a huge pain, so 95% of the time you default to rules of thumb
12:26 < Kimtruck> ??phantom mirror
12:26 < OCTOTROG> phantom mirror[1/4]: An evocable - creates a friendly illusory duplicate of a target monster; consumed on use. Duration increases with Evocations and decreases with target's MR (minimum duration is 6). Stacks in your inventory! For the rakshasa ability, see {rakshasa[2]}.
12:31 < Kimtruck> ??minotaur's labyrinth
12:31 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled minotaur's_labyrinth in my learndb.
12:32 < Kimtruck> ??labyrinth
12:32 < OCTOTROG> labyrinth[1/7]: Look for a cyan \ (or ? depending on your character set) on a level where you hear an "ancient clock" or "distant snort". (1-in-15 chance per level, once per game). Hurry, it times out much more quickly than other portals (you get urgent-sounding messages). Note that magic mapping will show where the lab entrance is.
12:34 < omnomnOMINOUS> try to get in close vs the orb spiders; they're dangerous from range but not really up close
12:38 < odiv> ^whereis kimtruck
12:39 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Bludgeoner (L12 MiBe), a worshipper of Trog, is currently on Lair:3 after 10913 turns. [cbro]
12:39 < odiv> I'm getting crazy lag in this irc thing.
12:40 < odiv> I think it's from this PC to my home server.
12:40 < omnomnOMINOUS> hi odiv! _o/
12:42 < odiv> hey, what's up?
12:42 < odiv> oh wow, lag is gone, that's great
12:43 < odiv> So Kim, have you heard the good news about Vehumet yet?
12:43 < omnomnOMINOUS> wait i have not heard the good news about vehumet
12:44 < odiv> Vehumet is your God and will assist you in raining down unending fire upon your enemies.
12:44 < omnomnOMINOUS> oh that good news
12:44 < odiv> Only the most important news.
12:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> ok yes i have heard that =P
12:45 < odiv> Would you take a pamphlet?
12:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> haha sure, is it a manual of conjurations?
12:45 < odiv> It's actually just a piece of paper that's on fire.
12:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> i was thinking if anyone still needs a team name, "Mornings Are For Coffee And Conjurations" would be a good one
12:45 < odiv> I need to hand them out quickly, for obvious reasons.
12:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> lol
12:46 < Kimtruck> I'm fine being a MiBe for now
12:47 < Kimtruck> ??oklob
12:47 < OCTOTROG> oklob plant[1/7]: An immobile plant that spits acid. Can be affected by hexes.
12:47 < omnomnOMINOUS> it's like a turret basically; unless it's guarding something important it's easiest to just avoid the headache and go elsewhere
12:48 < odiv> if you need to get rid of it, then it can't see invis
12:48 < odiv> !polytheist
12:49 < odiv> !!polytheist

12:50 < OCTOTROG> Unwon species for odiv: Felid, Formicid, Mummy, Ogre, Spriggan, Tengu
12:52 < omnomnOMINOUS> ok off to the gym; bbl. good luck kim! a couple thoughts from spectating: (1) start thinking about running away sooner (at 1/2 health), (2) use consumables liberally, and (3) if something notices you, back up far away to an already-explored spot, and let it come to you; the sound it makes will attract more monsters
12:53 < Kimtruck> ??slime pits
12:53 < OCTOTROG> slime pits[1/2]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere on levels 5 or 6 (on Lair:6-8 in 0.18-). Five levels deep (six in 0.18-), with a rune in the loot vault at the bottom, surrounded by stone (vulnerable to LRD/shatter but not passwall/digging) walls. Killing the royal jelly turns the walls into diggable glass. The {slime wall}s hurt to touch!
12:53 < Kimtruck> thanks omnomnOMINOUS !
12:53 < omnomnOMINOUS> slime pits are super dangerous don't go in there
13:04 < odiv> pits are usually for the post endgame
13:04 < odiv> or extended or w/e
13:06 < Kimtruck> +8 antimagic great mace on a berserker
13:06 < Kimtruck> this should be good
13:07 < odiv> sweet
13:07 < odiv> I <3 Antimagic
13:08 < odiv> though usually on something fast
13:08 < Kimtruck> ??steam dragon armor
13:08 < OCTOTROG> steam dragon armor ~ steam dragon armour[1/1]: 5AC, 0ER, rSteam. Can be created by enchanting a steam dragon hide.
13:08 < odiv> 0ER is too light
13:09 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Warrior (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, blasted by a fire dragon (blast of flame) on Lair:6, with 41664 points after 16237 turns and 1:17:43. [cbro]
13:10 < odiv> oh no
13:13 < odiv> rip :(
13:16 < roj> It'd be neat to get an extended death available (in a quicker version than dump).
13:17 < roj> like Kimtruck was poisoned, turning to stone, and out of mp. there were 15 harpies nearby.
13:22 < greynaab> ^whereis
13:22 < OCTOTROG> greynaab the Spry (L25 SpHu), a worshipper of Jiyva, saved on Depths:2 on 2016-05-22 after 123802 turns. [cbro]

13:27 < zackoid> i onced finished a game 366 days after start.  
13:31 < zackoid> i wish i could remember where rc files are
13:31 < odiv> o
13:31 < odiv> I think, right?
13:31 < odiv> o for edit options
13:32 < zackoid> i mean from irc, i try not to hit the actual game pages from work
13:32 < odiv> you mean from ssh?
13:32 < odiv> or can you somehow edit them via irc?
13:33 < zackoid> i don't even want to edit it, just read it
13:35 < odiv> !!rc odiv
13:35 < odiv> does that work?
13:35 < odiv> hm
13:35 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.akrasiac.org/rcfiles/crawl-git/odiv.rc
13:35 < odiv> change url to cbro and you?

13:36 < odiv> !^rc zackoid
13:36 < odiv> I don't think ^^ is a thing.
13:36 < zackoid> i think i tried that and they were in another directory on cbro
13:36 < zackoid> yeah.
13:36 < odiv> We use !! to pass unknown commands straight through.
13:36 < odiv> afaik
13:37 < zackoid> i thought that was just sequel
13:37 < zackoid> i can never remember the bot operators.  i even made a db entry about the bot operators but i can't remember the bot operator for the db
14:03 < Kimtruck> 1st level of dungeon, +5 int ring for a beserker. yup. this'll be useful.
14:10 < Kimtruck> ??potion of mutation
14:10 < OCTOTROG> potion of mutation[1/1]: Attempts to give you three random mutations. Also, outputs the message "you feel extremely strange" whether it succeeds or not -- if you're looking here to see what that message means, you probably quaffed this while resistant to mutations.
14:20 < Kimtruck> ??inference
14:20 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled inference in my learndb.

14:20 < Kimtruck> hmmm
14:20 < Kimtruck> new brand?
14:21 < Kimtruck> rF+, Str+4
14:22 < zackoid> ??randart
14:22 < OCTOTROG> randart[1/5]: A randomly generated artefact; its appearance and name have no special significance. Keep in mind that artefact status by itself does not dictate worthiness. A +8 randart hand axe (with +3 str) is still not a battleaxe, and a +5 ring mail (with +rage) is still not a plate mail.
14:23 < zackoid> randarts can have properties that don't normally generate on items of that type
14:23 < zackoid> and also multiple properties
14:39 <@slitherrrr> and some fixedart stuff has stuff that doesn't even generate on randarts
14:39 <@slitherrrr> ??crusher
14:39 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled crusher in my learndb.
14:39 <@slitherrrr> ??punk
14:39 < OCTOTROG> punk[1/1]: An {unrand} +3 {fustibalus} with an acid ego (same as {acidic bite}) that grants rCorr. In 0.18-, a +7 greatsling with freeze ego and rC+.

14:40 < OCTOTROG> unrandart[1/2]: An artefact of fixed appearance and properties - sometimes unique ones that are unavailable anywhere else. Info at: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/art-data.txt
14:41 <@slitherrrr> ??skullcrusher
14:41 <@slitherrrr> there
14:41 < OCTOTROG> skullcrusher[1/1]: The +3 giant club "Skullcrusher" {speed, Str+7}.
14:42 <@slitherrrr> or sometimes fixedarts are things that no longer exist but were just too awesome to die
14:42 <@slitherrrr> like
14:42 <@slitherrrr> ??autumn
14:42 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled autumn in my learndb.
14:43 <@slitherrrr> ??autumn katana
14:43 < OCTOTROG> autumn katana[1/1]: (long blades; +3 acc / 14 dam / 1.2 base delay / 0.6 min delay). A +8 vorpal katana {clarity} that didn't get the news about katana removal.
14:43 <@slitherrrr> (that weapon is amazing by the way)
14:43 <@slitherrrr> ??eudemon blade
14:43 < OCTOTROG> eudemon blade[1/3]: (long blades; -2 acc / 14 dam / 1.2 base delay / 0.6 min delay). Created by having The Shining One {bless} a demon blade.
14:44 < Kimtruck> ??scroll of brand weapon
14:44 < OCTOTROG> scroll of brand weapon[1/2]: Adds a random brand to a non-artefact, non-blowgun weapon (see[2]). Rebranding away from wielded distortion does not cause a distortion unwield effect.
14:44 <@slitherrrr> ??scroll of brand weapon[2
14:44 < OCTOTROG> scroll of brand weapon[2/2]: Brands melee weapons to: 19.0% flaming, 19.0% freezing, 15.8% vorpal, 12.7% venom, 9.49% drain, 9.49% electrocution, 7.59% protection, 5.06% vampiricism, 1.90% chaos. Ranged weapons: 25% flame, 25% frost, 16.6% venom, 16.6% vorpal, 10% evasion, 4.2% electrocution, 2.5% chaos. Reroll if same as current brand or disliked by your god.
14:44 < Kimtruck> ??crushing
14:44 < OCTOTROG> vorpal[1/3]: A weapon brand which increases weapon damage by 16.7% on average.
14:45 <@slitherrrr> vorpal is better than it sounds
14:45 <@slitherrrr> less damage+ than flaming or freezing, but it works on everything
15:02 < Kimtruck> ??lair
15:02 < OCTOTROG> lair[1/2]: Accessed from the main dungeon somewhere between levels 8 and 11. Six levels deep (eight in 0.18-). The lair is full of "natural" critters such as rats, snakes, and yaks. One of Swamp/Shoals and one of Snake/Spider appears there, as well as Slime, and there is a relatively hard vault on Lair:8. The petting zoo of Crawl, if petting zoos had hydras.
15:09 < Kimtruck> ??haste
15:09 < OCTOTROG> haste[1/1]: Reduces action delay by 33%. Most commonly found as a potion of haste (formerly known as speed), wand of hasting, and a level 6 Charms spell.
15:15 < Kimtruck> ??amulet of piety
15:15 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled amulet_of_piety in my learndb.
15:15 < Kimtruck> ????amulet of faith
15:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> amulet of faith is good
15:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> much better than gourmand
15:15 < Kimtruck> yeah I'm just trying to figure out which amulet to wear
15:15 < Kimtruck> well that answers one of my two maulet questions
15:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> (i'm in ur spectator tab btw)
15:16 < omnomnOMINOUS> the little thing at the bottom right
15:16 < Kimtruck> yeah
15:16 < Kimtruck> faith vs regen?
15:16 < omnomnOMINOUS> faith i think is one of the strongest amulets in the game? someone else can correct me if i'm wrong
15:16 < omnomnOMINOUS> but being able to use god powers more is really strong
15:23 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Warrior (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by a death yak on Lair:6, with 39052 points after 16991 turns and 1:16:05. [cbro]
15:23 < Kimtruck> dumb way to die
15:24 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah eventually you get a sense of what fights you can take and what fights you run from
15:25 < omnomnOMINOUS> often when you run away some of the pack will lose you; don't be afraid to run all the way to an upstairs as long as the monsters aren't faster than you
15:27 < odiv> I criminally underuse god powers.
15:27 < odiv> Which is probably partially why Vehumet is so awesome.
15:27 < zackoid> Kimtruck: is that the third straight lair:6?
15:28 < odiv> Kim will be our secret weapon.
15:29 < Kimtruck> zackoid, I think so? 
15:29 < Kimtruck> is that unusual?
15:30 < zackoid> yeah, though not supremely.  the last level of branches is usually a difficulty spike.
15:31 < zackoid> the unusual part is that there aren't d:3 and d:4 deaths mixed in, given your amount of time with the game
15:31 < omnomnOMINOUS> ^
15:31 < Kimtruck> I think I've had 1 d2 and 1 d4
15:31 < omnomnOMINOUS> the early parts of the dungeon actually make up a huge percentage of deaths
15:31 < Kimtruck> everything else has been d:12 or Lair
15:32 < zackoid> maybe the bot doesn't report all deaths anymore
15:32 < zackoid> i noticed it's not reporting starts
15:33 < zackoid> some lair:6 endings are way more deadly than the rest of lair, too.
15:33 < Kimtruck> can I find a list of every run I've made somewhere?
15:35 < zackoid> there's a website but it appears to be broken currently
15:35 < zackoid> !!lg Kimtruck s=place
15:35 < OCTOTROG> 9 games for Kimtruck: 3x Lair:6, D:5, D:4, D:2, D:7, D:8, D:12
15:35 < zackoid> or you can use the bots.
15:36 < Kimtruck> yeah, so it went D:12, then 2 and 4, then 7 and 8, then 3 Lairs
15:36 < zackoid> movin' on up
15:36 < zackoid> !!lg Kimtruck -log
15:36 < OCTOTROG> 9. kimtruck, XL13 MiBe, T:16991: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/morgue-kimtruck-20161101-192318.txt
15:37 < Kimtruck> so how would you guys recommend I go? should I go deeper in the dungeon, come back up for Lair, and then go even further up for Mines? 
15:37 < Kimtruck> or should I keep on doing what I've been doing and hit Lair as soon as I clear the level where one can find its door?
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah i usually jump into lair and/or orc as soon as i see them
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> but! i often back up out of their last level
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> as soon as it starts looking scary
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> then when i'm stronger i go back and clear their last levels
15:38 < zackoid> i usually do d:9 or d:10, then lair.  in general you have the right idea, but it's important to be flexible if you are struggling.  they've changed the meta a bit lately so it's not as flexible as it used to be
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> last level of orc has some nice shops
15:39 < zackoid> ??hyperelliptic
15:39 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot
15:39 < zackoid> that's the basic idea.
15:40 < Kimtruck> "get Rune"
15:40 < Kimtruck> ??rune
15:40 < OCTOTROG> rune[1/2]: Mystic keys (and status symbols) - you need at least three to enter Zot. They can be found at the end of some (but not all) dungeon branches, in Abyss:3-5, or in certain levels in Pandemonium. Runes are permanent, weightless once picked up, and tracked outside of inventory.
15:40 < Hildebrand> bot doesnt seem to be reporting :(
15:40 < zackoid> that means to finish those branches.  you need 3 runes in order to enter zot, the branch where the mcguffin is
15:40 < omnomnOMINOUS> oh yeah, also whether or not you have poison resistance sometimes affects how confident you can be when entering lair
15:41 < Hildebrand> no rP makes lair fun
15:42 < zackoid> Kimtruck: i don't see any obvious strategic mistakes in that last log.  training is fine, might be worth talking about ranged weapons after you've hit min delay.  dive order is fine.  have you used brothers in arms ever?  it's very expensive in terms of piety but also the best panic button in the game
15:42 < zackoid> also, do you grok the downside to berserking?  status effects can be non-obvious because of turn based.
15:42 < Hildebrand> i tend to spam trog hand the most, bia if its a real oh s* moment, and zerker rage when i just gotta clear a room
15:43 < Hildebrand> nothing like entering v5, popping all three, and watching everything die
15:43 < Hildebrand> ??cpa
15:43 < OCTOTROG> crystal plate armour[1/2]: 14AC, 23ER.
15:43 < Hildebrand> needs more that too
15:44 < Hildebrand> hrmm, bot no report my death?
15:45 < Kimtruck> zackoid, no, never used it. I also regularly forget to use wands
15:45 < Hildebrand> to a ghost, sigh
15:45 < Kimtruck> yeah the slow/exh can be brutal
15:45 < Kimtruck> I try to reserve Beserking for not-quite-panicking-yet 
15:45 < zackoid> i think they changed the threshold for notability for the bots, but i thought johnstein was going around that
15:45 < Kimtruck> and mainly rely on Hand of Trog since I can usually afford the Hunger penalty
15:46 < zackoid> berserking is best to take down single enemies, preferably somewhere where the noise won't draw any more.  
15:46 < zackoid> trog's hand is good but regen only makes a small difference in a single fight
15:47 < Kimtruck> I tend to beserk if I've got a large crowd of relatively high-level enemies in a hallway
15:47 < Kimtruck> just so I can cut through them while minimizing my HP loss
15:47 < zackoid> that's probably a good time to run away instead, because the berserk might run out halfway through, and then you're in trouble
15:48 < omnomnOMINOUS> running away is the best ability in the game
15:49 < Kimtruck> so how can you run away from quick enemies like demons or hoppy frogs? 
15:49 < Kimtruck> or do you just not?
15:49 < zackoid> i'm of the (unusual? possibly wrong) opinion that once you can get to lair, playing berserkers just teaches bad habits.  it says when the going gets tough, HULK OUT when most of the time the right answer is FLEE!  FLEE FOR YOUR LIFE!
15:49 < omnomnOMINOUS> sometimes you can't run away
15:49 < zackoid> fast things you can't run very far from, but you can back up or take upstairs so that at least nobody else will join the party
15:49 < omnomnOMINOUS> so you can use a haste or teleport or blink or something
15:50 < Kimtruck> ok
15:50 < Kimtruck> let's say I want to stop playing berserker
15:50 < Kimtruck> any recs for a next class?
15:50 < Hildebrand> basically, zackoid leads a life of no fun
15:50 < zackoid> or you can call a summon and block a hallway with it so they can't chase you
15:50 < zackoid> i may or may not have been part of a team who's uniforms were emblazoned with Team No Fun.
15:50 < Kimtruck> my work Slack icon is the No Fun robot
15:51 < Kimtruck> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/731/143/3e3.jpg
15:51 < zackoid> Kimtruck: gargoyle or minotaur fighter probs
15:51 < zackoid> note that you don't start with a god, you have to find an altar.
15:51 < odiv> Is the bot not reporting every milestone anymore?
15:51 < odiv> on cbro?
15:51 < zackoid> i think not
15:52 < odiv> I think there was a channel that both bots shared, right?
15:52 < odiv> or was it just msgs?
15:52 < greynaab> Stop playing berserker???  Trog is not very happy
15:52 < odiv> Kimtruck: DrCj!
15:52 < odiv> (though probably not really)
15:52 < zackoid> i don't see any cbro+ announcements at all.
15:53 < zackoid> Kimtruck: gargoyles are fun because they have complete immunity to poison and get tons of AC naturally.  downside is they are less versatile and have less HP than Mi.
15:57 < odiv> for a caster DEFE is pretty good actually.
15:57 < Kimtruck> so maybe a gargoyle melee?
15:58 < odiv> Though Dr is nice because then you don't have to worry about armour for a hybrid
15:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> if you're interested in a god that is like trog but lets you use magic, okawaru is a good option
15:58 < odiv> Hill Orc Monk of Makhleb is fun
15:58 < odiv> and orcs are good at hitting things with axes.
15:58 < zackoid> Kimtruck: don't listen to odiv.
15:58 < odiv> what
15:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> lol
15:58 < odiv> HOMo of Makhleb is super great!
15:58 < odiv> !apt ho
15:58 < OCTOTROG> HO: Fighting: 2, Short: 0, Long: 1, Axes: 3!, Maces: 1, Polearms: 1, Staves: -1, Slings: -1, Bows: -1, Xbows: -1, Throw: -1, Armour: 1, Dodge: -2, Stealth: -1, Shields: 1, UC: 1!, Splcast: -3, Conj: 0, Hexes: 0, Charms: -1, Summ: 0, Nec: 0, Tloc: -2, Tmut: -3, Fire: 1, Ice: -1, Air: -2, Earth: 0, Poison: -1, Inv: 3!, Evo: 0, Exp: 0, HP: 1, MP: 0
15:59 < zackoid> yes i agree but she's played like 6 games of MiBe.  keep it simple.
15:59 < odiv> 3 invocations! 3 axes!
15:59 < Kimtruck> chainmail on d2, gorgeous
15:59 < odiv> HP on kill is pretty sweet for simple
15:59 < odiv> but yeah, I guess Gr is probably better for immunities
15:59 < zackoid> also Mo is a terrible background
16:00 < odiv> Yeah, there's probably better for an HO of Makhleb.
16:01 < odiv> !lg odiv won HO
16:01 < OCTOTROG> 3. odiv the Axe Maniac (L27 HOMo of Beogh), escaped with the Orb and 3 runes on 2015-03-19 16:12:41, with 1632916 points after 74367 turns and 7:04:09.
16:01 < odiv> does that work?
16:01 < zackoid> !!lg . won HO--
16:01 < OCTOTROG> 5. zackoid the Axe Maniac (L27 HOMo of Qazlal), escaped with the Orb and 3 runes on 2016-04-02 19:23:10, with 1631605 points after 81381 turns and 4:52:07.
16:01 < odiv> look at my time!
16:01 < odiv> I really need to speed up.
16:02 < zackoid> that game i deliberately set out to play as fast as possible and it still took me 5 hours.
16:02 < zackoid> a normal game would be like 9.  i'm really really slow.
16:02 < Kimtruck> ??flail
16:02 < OCTOTROG> flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; +0 acc / 10 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A mace with a short chain connecting the head to the haft.
16:02 < Kimtruck> ??mace
16:02 < OCTOTROG> mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 8 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A short club with a metal head.
16:03 < odiv> ^whereis Kimtruck
16:03 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Cudgeler (L6 MiBe), a worshipper of Trog, is currently on D:3 after 1905 turns. [cbro]
16:03 < zackoid> Kimtruck: you can also see that information in game.  open the inventory and select the letter of the weapon
16:03 < zackoid> it will also tell your current swing speed, iirc
16:03 < odiv> hey neckro and johnstein: any idea why we're not getting all announces from cbro? was it turned off in anticipation of tournament flood?
16:03 < zackoid> or at least the skill vs mindelay
16:06 < neckro> uh... I haven't touched anything
16:06 < neckro> I was intending to give the bot some attention tonight though
16:07 < neckro> for the first time in forever
16:08 < zackoid> i know there was some talk about changing what gets reported upstream, but i thought it hadn't happened yet.
16:08 < neckro> johnstein might have messed with something, basically octotrog just parrots whatever rotatell sez
16:13 < Kimtruck> first go at a caster lasted about 20 turns\
16:14 < zackoid> that is pretty normal.
16:14 < odiv> I was also intending to give the bot some attention tonight.
16:14 < odiv> If you know what I'm saying.
16:15 < odiv> If you do know what I'm saying, please tell me.
16:15 < Kimtruck> no matter how you choose to parse that, it probably includes an increased risk for carpal tunnel!
16:16 < neckro> people love machines in 2016 a.d.
16:17 < Hildebrand> hmmm, thats a lovely combo
16:17 < Hildebrand> the elf twins and a ghost
16:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> hildebrand, i ran into your ghost!
16:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> Hildebrand's ghost screams in joy, "As in life, so in death: Kill! Kill!! Kill!!!"
16:47 < Hildebrand> good ghost
18:09 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Covert (L11 OpEn), worshipper of Dithmenos, shot by an orc knight (bolt) on Orc:2, with 7322 points after 10940 turns and 0:40:15. [cbro]
20:18 < odiv> grr, since switchhhhhing to wifi my wireless kb has been        terrible
20:18 < odiv> see what I mean?
20:18 <@ZureaL> are we no longer announcing milestones in here?
20:18 <@ZureaL> like unique kills, games starting, etc?
20:19 < odiv> nlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyythe ones in      ##crawl looks liikke
20:19 < advil> they might have cut announcements in ##crawl
20:19 < odiv> usuallly the not significant milestones get passeed to octotrog via  special channel.
20:20 < odiv> I don't know why that's not working
20:20 < odiv> neckro hasn't changed anything.
20:20 < odiv> maybe johnstein needs to update something.
20:22 < odiv> God, fuck this keyboard.
20:47 < Hildebrand> johnstein and neckro need to get together and figure it out
21:18 < OCTOTROG> zureal the Cleaver (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by a catoblepas on Lair:5, with 26671 points after 17704 turns and 1:02:12. [cbro]
21:18 <@ZureaL> that's a first
21:22 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Covert (L12 OpAs), worshipper of Dithmenos, demolished by a meliai (a +0 hand axe) on Lair:4, with 13363 points after 13544 turns and 0:47:02. [cbro]
22:05 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Covert (L11 OpEn), worshipper of Dithmenos, mangled by an eight-headed hydra on Lair:1, with 10507 points after 12780 turns and 0:42:15. [cbro]
23:01 < johnstein> hmm. announcements should be the same
23:01 < johnstein> I will look into it
23:02 < johnstein> looks ok from a cursory scan
23:02 < johnstein> I will dig into it later
23:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/omnomnOMINOUS/omnomnOMINOUS.txt what should i be training next? i assume i want more skill in armor so i can wear pearl dragon armor?
23:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> is the +11 hand crossbow worth investing skill points into?
--- Day changed Wed Nov 02 2016
00:05 < zackoid> johnstein: definitely not reporting anything but deaths in here
00:06 < omnomnOMINOUS> (oh hm, or is PDA going to make me too unstealthy?)
00:07 < johnstein> !lm mfc cv=0.19
00:07 < OCTOTROG> 180. [2016-11-02 02:54:53] omnomnOMINOUS the Jinx (L11 VpEn of Dithmenos) entered a Labyrinth on turn 11316. (Lair:3)
00:07 < johnstein> I bet I forgot to update Rotatelljr
00:07 < advil> PDA is very good but it is slightly heavier than you'd want on a VpEn
00:07 < johnstein> I bet 0.18 works ok
00:10 < advil> it's also extraordinarily rare to have found it by lair 3
00:11 < omnomnOMINOUS> i have pearl dragon scales
00:11 < omnomnOMINOUS> only 2 enchant armour scrolls though
00:11 < advil> I think they changed how that works
00:11 < omnomnOMINOUS> (i found the scales in a minotaur labyrinth)
00:11 < advil> there's only one level, and scales = old armour
00:11 < advil> no more hides
00:12 < advil> so I haven't double checked to be sure this is exactly true, but PDA = PDS
00:12 < omnomnOMINOUS> wait really?
00:16 < advil> yeah, I'm sure about scales in 0.19, just not 100% they didn't tweak any stats
00:18 < advil> %%git ba71d7cf505c
00:18 < OCTOTROG> PleasingFungus * 0.19-a0-1848-gba71d7c: Rename: dragon armour -> dragon scales (4 weeks ago, 49 files, 215+ 191-) https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/ba71d7cf505c
00:18 < omnomnOMINOUS> ah ok
00:19 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah so i'm not sure whether i should stick with the stealthy stabbiness or maybe pivot into long blades and armor, or something entirely different
00:20 < advil> and
00:20 < advil> %%git cd7d164f1251
00:20 < OCTOTROG> PleasingFungus * 0.19-a0-1847-gcd7d164: Remove hides (4 weeks ago, 44 files, 153+ 422-) https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/cd7d164f1251
00:20 < omnomnOMINOUS> ah makes sense
00:20 < advil> well a Vp does well pivoting into long blades but I think you're in a position where you need to stick with stealth for the time being
00:21 < advil> what do the scales do to your stealth when you wear them?
00:21 < advil> your Str also seems a bit low to me for PDA
00:22 < omnomnOMINOUS> right now i have Stlth  ++++++++++, wearing the scales Stlth  ++++++++..
00:22 < advil> yeah, I probably wouldn't wear that right now
00:22 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah i wouldn't swap to PDA immediately
00:22 < advil> it'd be a while
00:23 < advil> probably more importantly I expect it will kill your spell fail rates for the foreseeable future
00:23 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah for sure
00:24 < omnomnOMINOUS> would it make sense to start training long blades and armor, or keep training hexes and stealth (currently 15 and 12 respectively)?
00:25 < advil> do you have a good long blade?
00:25 < omnomnOMINOUS> nope!
00:25 < omnomnOMINOUS> there is a scimitar of freezing lying around somewhere
00:26 < advil> that's not bad, if you want to change over I'd say that's a good enough weapon to start
00:28 < omnomnOMINOUS> nods
00:29 < advil> armour maybe don't focus yet, it's unclear to me when PDA would become viable on a VpEn of dith
00:30 < advil> though that's so rare to find you might do it on those grounds.  but it really would be more of an endgame armour even still
00:30 < omnomnOMINOUS> i see
00:30 < advil> you need more str, and a whole bunch of armour skill
00:30 < advil> I'd probably fsim it if it were my char
00:30 < advil> well not fsim it exactly, test in wizard mode offline
00:31 < advil> for comparison my VpEn ended the game in +5 leather, so basically what you're wearing now
00:31 < advil> sorry, +3 leather!
00:31 < advil> so worse than you have now
00:32 < advil> !lg . vpen won -log
00:32 < OCTOTROG> 1. advil, XL27 VpEn, T:113523: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/advil/morgue-advil-20150502-144215.txt
00:32 < omnomnOMINOUS> ah ok!
00:32 < advil> I went long blades also
00:33 < advil> my air magic strat there looks a bit silly tbh, don't do that
00:34 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah this is useful to see
00:35 < advil> !lg zackoid vpen won -log
00:35 < OCTOTROG> 1. zackoid, XL27 VpEn, T:108474: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20151122-041117.txt
00:35 < zackoid> mine apparently finished the game in a robe.
00:35 < advil> zackoid's may be a better point of comparison because it is dith
00:35 < zackoid> though it was +5, and had an AC buckler.
00:36 < zackoid> and ozo's wasn't crap.  and haste, mass confusion and phase shift existed :(
00:36 < omnomnOMINOUS> hehe
00:36 < advil> true, I suspect this sort of character is just weaker in 0.19
00:37 < zackoid> yeah light armour melee killdudes is gonna be pretty tough now
00:37 < zackoid> especially in zot
00:38 < zackoid> omnomnOMINOUS: is your hexes skill already 15?
00:38 < advil> well maybe learning tornado would make sense now!
00:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> yes
00:39 < zackoid> are you training it for something besides power?
00:39 < omnomnOMINOUS> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/omnomnOMINOUS/omnomnOMINOUS.txt
00:39 < omnomnOMINOUS> umm i just switched off training it; now i just have fighting / long blades / dodging on
00:40 < zackoid> if you have invis castable you probably want to work on some other stuff for awhile yeah
00:40 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah invis is super castable
00:42 < omnomnOMINOUS> (thanks for the advice, everyone =)
00:54 < johnstein> let me know if milestones get announced again

06:56 < OCTOTROG> lair[1/2]: Accessed from the main dungeon somewhere between levels 8 and 11. Six levels deep (eight in 0.18-). The lair is full of "natural" critters such as rats, snakes, and yaks. One of Swamp/Shoals and one of Snake/Spider appears there, as well as Slime, and there is a relatively hard vault on Lair:8. The petting zoo of Crawl, if petting zoos had hydras.
06:57 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Basher (L11 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by an unseen horror on D:10, with 7867 points after 9604 turns and 0:40:28. [cbro]
06:58 < Kimtruck> ??unseen horror
06:58 < OCTOTROG> unseen horror[1/5]: "These creatures are usually unseen by the eyes of most, and those few who have seen them would rather not have." Moves like a bat, and invisible. A purple x if you can see invisible. The bane of mages and EV fighters everywhere.
07:14 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L1 MiBe) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
07:35 < Kimtruck> woulda survived had I thought to close doors, now that I read more about unseen horrors
07:35 < Kimtruck> learning about fleeing as a berserker: lessons learned too late
08:46 < zackoid> doors are the most overpowered item in the game!  slightly ahead of nets.
09:08 < kimtrucks> is johnstein's server down for anyone else?
09:10 < zackoid> seems so
09:12 < kimtrucks> I briefly have no work to do
09:12 < kimtrucks> brb need to gently sob at lack of crawl
09:31 < zackoid> you could start a game on one of the other servers in desperation
09:38 < greynaab> i just sent Johnstein a text to let him know about CBRO
09:42 < kimtrucks> danke
10:49 < odiv> Did Kim win yet?
10:49 < odiv> :D
10:52 < odiv> ^whereis
10:52 < OCTOTROG> odiv the Destroyer (L11 DrCj), a worshipper of Vehumet, saved on Lair:2 on 2016-09-16 after 13688 turns. [cbro]
10:52 < odiv> I should join ##crawl
10:52 < odiv> and maybe the SA one
10:52 < odiv> which network again?
10:56 < neckro> irc.freenode.net
10:56 < neckro> there's also an #octolog there which is where the cbro+ stuff comes from
10:57 < odiv> k thanks.
10:57 < odiv> I don't think I'm there right now?
10:57 < odiv> doesn't seem like it
10:57 < odiv> Now I have to look up irssi stuff again. :P
11:02 < kimtrucks> odiv well berotato is down today
11:02 < kimtrucks> :(
11:02 < odiv> :(
11:03 < kimtrucks> plan for this run, if I survive to Lair, is to back out of lair after L:5, go down to D:11 (if the Lair entrance wasn't there), then do first few levels of Mine, back out, then try to complete L:6
11:03 < odiv> Mine is only 2 levels now.
11:03 < odiv> if you see a sorc/warlord/high priest usually gtfo
11:04 < kimtrucks> I'm also really liking Maces/Flails for tackling the Hydras problem

11:12 < zackoid> heh
11:12 < zackoid> there's a reddit thread where everyone is freaking out thinking it's shut down permanently
11:12 < zackoid> which i guess is fair given the cao and cszo problems
11:13 < johnstein> zackoid. I don't k ow why, but that makes me kinda amused
11:15 < johnstein> "seems like there's large scale Internet backbone issues"
11:15 < johnstein> that, or someone forgot to put money in the BeRotato account jar
11:15 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L3 MiFi) killed Jessica. (D:2) [cbro+]

11:17 < odiv> Is there a spot for donations?
11:17 < odiv> Because it feels like you're going to get hammered for the tournament.

11:22 < zackoid> probably robin's gang.
11:22 < odiv> also known as free helmet.
11:22 < kimtrucks> playing Mi, no helmets for me
11:22 < kimtrucks> yup, Robin has appeared
11:23 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L6 MiBe) killed Robin. (D:4) [cbro+]

11:26 < zackoid> heh, this is what i'm talking about when i say berserkers teach you the wrong lessons.  pikel on D:4 is a Situation.  though he's melee-only.
11:26 < johnstein> odiv: cao is back. I'm not default
11:27 < odiv> oh, cool, that's good
11:27 < odiv> did they consult with you at all though?
11:27 < johnstein> pikel on D4 means we head to D5
11:27 < johnstein> kinda
11:27 < johnstein> i explained it wasn't a feasible solution
11:27 < odiv> I mean about tournament timing.
11:27 < johnstein> and kept nagging them to give me access to cao so I could free up space and upgrade to 0.19
11:27 < kimtrucks> ??sewer
11:27 < OCTOTROG> sewer[1/4]: The Sewers, initially conceived by Eino Keskitalo, who apparently had some to spare. They are timed and will disappear eventually if you do not enter them. Usually contains rats, kobolds, adders. A couple layouts have giant frogs.
11:28 < johnstein> timing? never
11:28 < odiv> That seems suboptimal.
11:28 < kimtrucks> relative sewer difficulty? that makes it sound breezy beautiful covergirl
11:28 < johnstein> but serveral were just assuming that cbro would handle it. i had to explain a few times that it could not
11:28 < lukano> sewers are pretty easy for a beserker
11:28 < odiv> sewer is usually fine
11:28 < odiv> don't stand in water to fight.
11:29 < kimtrucks> thanks guys
11:29 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L8 MiBe) entered a sewer. (D:5) [cbro+]
11:29 < odiv> and snorg or whoever sometimes hangs out there.
11:29 < zackoid> purgy.
11:30 < kimtrucks> already murdered purgy
11:30 < zackoid> but i think she already killed him this game.  the frogs are the biggest problem.
11:30 < odiv> ah
11:30 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L6 MiFi) killed Duvessa. (D:4) [cbro+]
11:31 < kimtrucks> sewers was easy, thanks guys. (it was mostly blocked off by deep sewage, dunno if that's common)
11:31 < zackoid> most of the layouts you can get around it if you take the long way, there's one that only part is accessible without flight or swimming
11:31 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L8 MiBe) killed the ghost of jordan the Grappler, a novice DrTm of Ru. (D:5) [cbro+]
11:32 < odiv> DrTm of Ru sounds like fun.
11:32 < odiv> I'm a big fuckin' dragon, I don't need any friends!
11:33 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L7 MiFi) killed Prince Ribbit. (D:5) [cbro+]
11:34 < kimtrucks> steam dragon on d5. I do not like this.
11:34 < kimtrucks>  The steam dragon is sucked into a shaft!
11:34 < kimtrucks> _The shaft crumbles and collapses.
11:34 < kimtrucks> uhhh
11:34 < kimtrucks> that's fine by me
11:35 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L8 MiFi) killed Sigmund. (D:6) [cbro+]

11:39 < kimtrucks> I'm playing Tournament Version 0.19
11:40 < odiv> cool
11:41 < zackoid> i don't think flight interacts with any traps
11:43 < odiv> hey slitherrr
11:43 <@slitherrr> sup
11:45 < kimtrucks> yo

12:24 < kimtrucks> ??Swamp
12:24 < OCTOTROG> swamp[1/3]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere between levels 2 and 5. Four levels deep. Expect watery terrain and hydras throughout. A decaying rune lies at the bottom, usually guarded by swamp dragons and hydras. As swamp drakes emit mephitic clouds, you may want to have poison resistance or enhanced mental clarity.
12:25 < kimtrucks> ??shambling mangrove
12:25 < OCTOTROG> shambling mangrove[1/1]: Slow moving but strong plants. They have a 20% chance of containing a band of yellow or red wasps or ravens (they don't count as summons), which will only be released after the shambling mangrove has taken enough damage. They can also use entangling {roots}.

12:41 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L4 MiBe) killed Robin. (D:2) [cbro+]
12:43 < kimtrucks> ??amulet of guardian spirit
12:43 < OCTOTROG> guardian spirit[1/1]: While wearing this amulet, damage you take is divided proportionally between MP and HP. Reduces magic to 0 on wearing. Note that a Deep Dwarf wearing this does not regain MP naturally. Other races that mutate slow healing 3 still do, however.
12:44 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L4 MiBe) killed the ghost of Yackwabbit the Skirmisher, an amateur DsMo. (D:3) [cbro+]
12:45 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L9 MfGl) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:9) [cbro+]
12:46 < johnstein> kimtrucks, D1 plate is rarely a good idea. but for MiBe it's an excellent idea, though I'd train armour some more
12:46 < johnstein> ??plate
12:46 < OCTOTROG> plate armour[1/1]: 10AC, 18ER.
12:46 < johnstein> ??er
12:46 < OCTOTROG> encumbrance rating[1/3]: A number representing how much armour harms your spellcasting, dodging, and melee accuracy. Units are "arbitrary units of encumbrance" (aue).
12:46 < johnstein> !stats mibe
12:46 < johnstein> !!stats mibe
12:47 < johnstein> !!stat mibe

12:47 < johnstein> !!gameinfo kimtruck
12:47 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the L4 MiBe^Trog in D:3 (cbro tiles), T:1971, defenses: 17/9/0, stats: 27/4/10
12:47 < johnstein> so with 27 str, you can easily wear the plate without extra benefits
12:47 < johnstein> ??armour
12:47 < OCTOTROG> armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.
12:47 < johnstein> ??armour[2
12:47 < johnstein> ??armour[3
12:47 < OCTOTROG> armour[2/4]: Torment, smite, damnation, electrocution, and a handful of other abilities/effects ignore AC. The only player-castable damage spells that ignore AC are freeze, refrigeration, sticky flame, static discharge, pain, vampiric draining, Olgreb's Toxic Radiance, ignite poison, and agony. Note that all of these spells also ignore EV.
12:48 < OCTOTROG> armour skill[1/2]: Armour skill reduces the penalties associated with heavy armours, and increases the effectiveness of your armour by 1/22nd of its base value per level of skill.
12:48 < johnstein> but you will still have some of the penalties
12:48 < johnstein> but that should be outweighed by the AC and GDR
12:48 < johnstein> but I'd still make a point to train it a bit if you can spare the XP
12:48 < kimtrucks> it's currently at non-prioritized train
12:51 < johnstein> non-prioritized?

12:55 < kimtrucks> ??pain
12:55 < OCTOTROG> pain[1/3]: L1 necro spell, exclusive to the Book of Necromancy. Inflicts 1hp non-fatal damage on the caster. Does 1d(4 + pow/5) damage, with a limit of 25 power, and bypasses AC - but checks MR and only affects monsters without life protection, or players without torment immunity. You might've been looking for {pain brand}.
12:56 < kimtrucks> ??pain brand
12:56 < OCTOTROG> pain brand[1/2]: Brand which inflicts 1d(necromancy skill) extra damage on necro out of necro+1 successful hits. Does not affect those with rN (demons, undead, unliving, shadow dragons, death drakes, holies). (For the record, a monster's necromancy skill is HD/2, HD if undead or demonic, 0 if mindless/animal). Begins to edge out {elec brand} at 6 skill.

12:57 < johnstein> kimtrucks, pain is usually useless when you don't have necro sckill

15:33 < kimtrucks> ah
15:33 < kimtrucks> found the answer
15:33 < kimtrucks> no
15:33 < apoch> you are correct
15:34 < apoch> lair is not a rune branch
15:35 < kimtrucks> out of the lair
15:35 < kimtrucks> onto Mines

15:36 < zackoid> make sure to xv the new orcs
15:36 < zackoid> not all orcs are trash.
15:36 <@ZureaL> that's a nice weapon kimtrucks 
15:37 < kimtrucks> speaking of, that's a paladin-type orc
15:37 < zackoid> saint roka?
15:39 < kimtrucks> no, just a knight
15:39 < kimtrucks> oof
15:39 < kimtrucks> ??bardiche
15:39 < OCTOTROG> bardiche[1/1]: (polearms; -6 acc / 18 dam / 2.0 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). A long pole with an enormous, cleaving blade on one end. The largest polearm. Bardiches chop hydra heads.

16:07 < kimtrucks> the scary question of the hour:: do I open the runed door on Mines 2 after clearing rest of mines?
16:08 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L10 TeAE) killed Joseph. (D:7) [cbro+]
16:10 <@slitherrr> kimtrucks, the rewards may be grand! or they may be a banana
16:10 <@slitherrr> johnstein, do we know if ' is allowed in team names?
16:10 < kimtrucks> I'm less concerned about the reward than about the potential for getting my rear handed to me
16:10 < kimtrucks> runed doors have not historically contained presents
16:10 < johnstein> slitherrr: hm. I have no clue
16:11 < johnstein> kimtrucks: I'd probably open it. if you cleared mines you should be ok
16:11 < johnstein> mostly ok
16:11 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L11 TeAE) killed Grum. (D:9) [cbro+]
16:12 < kimtrucks> opened it
16:12 < kimtrucks> popped Brothers in Arm for first time but so far so good
16:12 < kimtrucks> ok, cleared the Mines entirely
16:14 < kimtrucks> any way to guarantee it's saved or should I just quit?
16:17 < kimtrucks> ??hyperelliptic
16:17 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot

16:19 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L11 TeAE) killed Erica. (D:11) [cbro+]
16:20 < kimtrucks> ^dump kimtruck
16:20 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
16:21 < zackoid> you should wear the MR+ ring and can drop the rpois ring as long as you have that cloak
16:21 < zackoid> you should use one of those ID scrolls on one of the wands of teleportation, it will tell you the # of charges, and using scrolls that are not-ID'd burns more than 1 charge per use
16:22 < zackoid> we should talk about acquirement before you go anywhere else.
16:23 < zackoid> and finally, now would be a good time to start boost a ranged attack of some kind
16:24 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L11 TeAE) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:10) [cbro+]
16:39 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L12 TeAE) killed Urug. (Lair:3) [cbro+]

16:45 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L13 TeAE) killed Sonja. (Lair:3) [cbro+]
16:47 < kimtrucks> zackoid: so I've accidentally read acquirement before
16:47 < kimtrucks> what should I know?
16:49 < zackoid> the most important thing is just that when you read it you have to decide what you want to acquire, you can't do anything or access any information while doing it
16:49 < zackoid> the second is that it's commonly referred to as the scroll of disappointment
16:49 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L13 TeAE) killed Harold. (Lair:4) [cbro+]
16:50 < zackoid> what you select depends mostly on what you already have and what you need.  usually an early one i'd select weapon, but trog gifts you weapons so that's not as important
16:50 < kimtrucks> my gorgeous +14 dire flail. Thanks Trog. Best Santa.
16:50 < zackoid> that is not an end-game weapon but it will do for now
16:50 < kimtrucks> jesus criminny how high do weapons get?!
16:51 < zackoid> normally +9 is the max for all weapons, randarts are allowed to go into the upper teens (very very rarely).
16:51 < zackoid> the issue is that with lots of skill, base weapon damage is much more important than enchantment (the +14), because it's multiplied by skill where enchantment is not
16:53 < zackoid> and a dire flail has relatively low base damage (13, the highest among maces is 17, and there are 1H weapons with as much or more dmg than the 2H dire flail
16:54 < zackoid> so that dire flail is an excellent weapon for the early game and for awhile, but trog will give you a great mace or eveningstar at some point that will be superior
16:54 < odiv> which mace is 17?
16:54 < odiv> ??maces
16:54 < OCTOTROG> maces & flails[1/2]: club (+3/5/1.3/0.6), whip (+2/6/1.1/0.5), hammer (+3/7/1.3/0.6), mace (+3/8/1.4/0.7), flail (+0/10/1.4/0.7), demon whip (+1/11/1.1/0.5), sacred scourge (+0/12/1.1/0.5), morningstar (-2/13/1.5/0.7), eveningstar (-1/15/1.5/0.7), dire flail (-3/13/1.3/0.6) [2], great mace (-4/17/1.7/0.7) [2], giant club (-6/20/1.7/0.7) [2], giant spiked club (-7/22/1.8/0.7) [2]
16:54 < zackoid> great.
16:54 < odiv> ah
16:54 < odiv> and -3 to -4 isn't crazy
16:54 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Zephyrmancer (L13 TeAE), worshipper of Vehumet, shot by Nessos (arrow) on Lair:5, with 29016 points after 22905 turns and 1:35:36. [cbro]
16:55 < zackoid> at high skill levels accuracy is not important i think
16:55 < zackoid> i didn't realize the dire flail is 0.6 speed, so it's not as crappy as i thought
16:56 < zackoid> maybe when i get home i'll FSIM it, rules of thumb on weapons have been wrong before
17:02 < kimtrucks> thanks zackoid
17:03 < kimtrucks> I think this is still in my first 15 runs. 
17:03 < kimtrucks> This is a pretty good run so far.
17:03 < kimtrucks> Just need to avoid getting cocky
17:05 < odiv> or get lucky!
17:08 < zackoid> anyway, as for acquirements i would go either wand or armour and expect garbage.  odiv will disagree.
17:08 < zackoid> doh, don't have parts showing in this channel.
17:08 < odiv> what?
17:08 < odiv> :P
17:31 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L12 DrCj) killed Harold. (Lair:2) [cbro+]

17:55 < zackoid> someone give me a good late-game monster for FSIM
17:55 < roj> I don't think I've ever seen one.
17:55 < roj> (a late game monster)
17:55 < roj> Some sort of... lightning... demon?
17:56 < zackoid> a blizzard demon, you must mean, since you have clearly been do the post-game content.
17:56 < zackoid> probably many many times.
17:56 < roj> Heh.

18:21 <@slitherrr> lol ok
18:23 < zackoid> so dispater is the first of 10 mobs i've tried FSIM with 
18:23 < zackoid> where a +14 dire flail is not at least slightly better than a +9 great mace
18:23 < zackoid> even at 20 skill, and 27 fighting
18:24 < roj> That sort of annoys me about DCSS, how the tradeoffs dissapear at higher weapon levels.
18:24 < zackoid> and this is just fsim so i didn't build the character up properly, but everything i can think of that i didn't account for makes the dire flail better, not worse
18:25 < zackoid> so that is very suprising to me
18:25 < zackoid> i expected it to be better than a +0 great mace, but only 5 enchantment overriding 4 base damage makes no sense to me
18:26 < zackoid> roj: the skill investment is the tradeoff, if i'm understanding you right
18:26 < roj> I more meant the whole +acc but less damage or vice versa within a single class.
18:27 < roj> Eventually those dissappear, if the writeup I read is correct, and maces are the best clubs and something is the best longblade, etc.
18:27 < zackoid> yeah, people generally ignore accuraccy entirely.  but they are also generally wrong.
18:28 < zackoid> like this test does not fit with the conventional wisdom at all
18:28 < zackoid> though dbro is out of date, it could be a bug
18:28 < zackoid> fun fact, once during a tournament that were a bug where player weapon damge was doubled
18:28 < zackoid> and nobody noticed for a week
18:28 < zackoid> that's how complicated DCSS combat is.
18:29 < roj> Well, they're all such bad asses.
18:29 < zackoid> or how complicated + how variable, i should say
18:29 < OCTOTROG> roj (L1 OpBe) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
18:30 < zackoid> octopodes are not complicated or variable though.  they just die.
18:33 <@slitherrr> ??great mace
18:33 < OCTOTROG> great mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; -4 acc / 17 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). An enormous metal war club, of great cumbrousness. The largest mace most playable races can wield. Ogres and Trolls can wield giant (spiked) clubs too.
18:33 <@slitherrr> ??dire flail
18:33 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.
18:36 <@slitherrr> zackoid, what strength, btw?
18:38 < zackoid> that was a mibe, i think like 27 str, not enough dex for end game
18:39 < roj> yeah, I don't even know what that means not enough dex for end game.
18:40 < roj> I am not a heavy tourney contributor.
18:40 <@slitherrr> do you still have the FSIM up? could you do it again with a GSC?
18:40 < roj> I DO look at every piece of armor I find, sooooo
18:41 < zackoid> i'd need to stat up a character that could weild it
18:41 < zackoid> wield.
18:41 <@slitherrr> ogbe?
18:42 < zackoid> i'd have to delete the current one which i'm not ready to do yet

19:05 < zackoid> free helmet!
19:05 < zackoid> also you want that flail.  and to wear that helmet.
19:06 < roj> e had no flail.
19:06 < roj> A friend of his did.
19:06 < roj> And I'm an octopode and can't wear the helm
19:06 < zackoid> oh right, only hats
19:06 < zackoid> which is ridiculous
19:07 < zackoid> octopodes have enough clothing problems.
19:08 < zackoid> you can also manage autopickups with \ nethack style
19:09 < zackoid> do you have any scroll stacks?
19:09 < zackoid> now would be a good time to read then on D:2

19:11 < zackoid> ??right of teleportation[2
19:12 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled right_of_teleportation[2] in my learndb.

19:12 < roj> Okay.

19:14 < zackoid> yeah, the worst things are like noise and teleportation which can't hurt as much a level with few enemies

19:49 < Kimtruck> oh hey trog gave me a great mace
19:49 < Kimtruck> let's see how it'll so
19:49 < Kimtruck> ??great mace
19:49 < OCTOTROG> great mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; -4 acc / 17 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). An enormous metal war club, of great cumbrousness. The largest mace most playable races can wield. Ogres and Trolls can wield giant (spiked) clubs too.
19:50 < zackoid> Kimtruck: contradicting everything i said earlier, i did some simulator tests and the dire flail is probably better.  what's the stats on the great mace?
19:50 < Kimtruck> +1, protection
19:50 < zackoid> also that is an amazing ring, you should start training invocations for it
19:50 < zackoid> err evocations, not invoke
19:50 < zackoid> yeah dire flail is way better than that
19:51 < Kimtruck> I'm being treated VERy nicely by RNG this run
19:51 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L6 VpEn) killed Sigmund. (D:4) [cbro+]
19:51 < Kimtruck> ^dump kimtruck
19:51 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
19:54 < Kimtruck> that's a lot of centaurs. suspect there's a named centaur dude at the other end of them
19:54 < Kimtruck> ??velocity
19:54 < OCTOTROG> velocity[1/2]: Vorpal ranged weapons are suffixed with 'velocity'. It gives 20% bonus damage and does not overwrite the ammunition brand.
19:54 < Kimtruck> oh jesus
19:54 < Kimtruck> RNG is good to me
19:57 < Kimtruck> ??rod
19:57 < OCTOTROG> rod[1/4]: Contains a spell. Wield and Evoke to cast it. Uses an internal mana pool which recharges gradually over time, even if not wielded. A scroll of recharging increases a rod's limit and enchantment by 1d2 (up to a max of 17 and +9 respectively), and (always) recharges its mp to full. See {rods} for a list of types.
19:59 < Kimtruck> D14 is just ugly thing fort
19:59 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L7 VpEn) killed Eustachio. (D:5) [cbro+]
20:01 < omnomnOMINOUS> rods can be pretty good if you're training up evocations for evoking invis from your ring anyway
20:04 < Kimtruck> hm
20:04 < Kimtruck> good to know
20:04 < Kimtruck> thanks
20:04 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L15 MiBe) reached level 15 of the Dungeon. (D:15) [cbro+]
20:05 < zackoid> rods are usually worth training evocations for anyway, though it's more cognitive load to deal with

20:10 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L15 MiBe) killed Louise. (D:15) [cbro+]

20:11 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot

20:14 < Kimtruck> I've heard tell that Shoals is now stupid hard
20:14 < Kimtruck> so I'
20:14 < Kimtruck> m going with Spider
20:15 < zackoid> they are all noticably harder than what you just finished
20:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> MR and a way to deal with projectiles is good for shoals; poison resistance is mandatory for spider. invisibility helps a ton in shoals (put your cursor over enemies with x and examine them with v, to check if they can see invisible)
20:15 < zackoid> be sure to check for special abilities among the spider hordes
20:21 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L8 VpEn) killed Prince Ribbit. (D:7) [cbro+]

21:24 < omnomnOMINOUS> getting to the last floor of a rune branch already is still extremely good though
21:25 < johnstein> Kimtruck, L16 is usually min level for me to attempt a final floor of a rune branch. I will often save it for later after clearing 1-3 of the other one or doing more D
21:25 < johnstein> but I'm a wimp
21:25 < Kimtruck> johnstein good to know!
21:26 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L9 DsCK) killed Pikel. (D:8) [cbro+]

21:40 < OCTOTROG> holy wrath[1/1]: Increases damage by 75% on average against undead and demons. These folks also cannot wield it. Does not hate evil creatures which are not undead or demons. This means that holy wrath is ineffective against hell knights, and some worshippers of evil gods can wield it.

21:40 < roj> I'm not switching to halbers for that.
21:41 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L9 VpEn) fell down a shaft to D:8. (D:7) [cbro+]

21:57 < Hildebrand> well, thats a new sewer layout
21:59 < Hildebrand> so zackoid, ring of stealth and ring of int are by far better for me than a +4 dex and {str+4 SInv} right?

22:02 < zackoid> no?
22:02 < roj> just wear all 8

22:02 < roj> oh heck yeah
22:03 < zackoid> int is almost worthless for a mibe.  only good for preventing stat death against stat drainers
22:03 < Hildebrand> was supposed to be a sarcastic question
22:04 < zackoid> that makes more sense
22:05 < roj> ??protection
22:05 < OCTOTROG> protection[1/1]: Bonus AC. On rings, anywhere from -6 to +6. On weapons, gives +7 AC for up to 5 turns when you successfully hit a monster that isn't {firewood}.

22:08 < roj> I dunno as I should be doing advanced play, here.
22:08 < roj> I do like wearing all teh rings

22:10 < zackoid> protection is actually useful for octopodes

22:12 < Hildebrand> oh, dumb quesiton

22:23 < Hildebrand> ok, another dumb question
22:23 < Hildebrand> it feels like they have changed the skill point aquistion for fighting, is that true?
22:26 < johnstein> ?
22:26 < johnstein> you mean for auto skilling?
22:26 < johnstein> I don't think anyone does that
22:26 < zackoid> the aura means it's friendly, they use auras instead of smily faces now
22:26 < zackoid> Hildebrand: you meant the apt?
22:27 < Hildebrand> i mean, i have 8.3 levels in fighting, 12.3 in axes
22:28 < Hildebrand> it used to be a fair bit more balanced leveling between those
22:28 < Hildebrand> ??apt mi
22:28 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled apt_mi in my learndb.
22:28 < zackoid> never used auto skilling
22:29 < Hildebrand> not using auto skilling, just doing the old fighting+axes, then after getting some points in that, adding some armour and dodge
22:29 < roj> I will futz with priorities but it's still mostly auto skill.
22:30 < zackoid> i don't think anything changed with that
22:30 < Hildebrand> whats the command to pull up the aptitudes again?

22:30 < OCTOTROG> fighting[1/1]: The Fighting skill gives you a bonus to accuracy and damage in melee and ranged, and improves your hit points by Fighting * (3/2 + XL/14) (see {hp}). Its effect on your damage is 0.83x the effect of weapon skill (not counting increases in attack speed), so if you want to hit hard then train it too.

22:45 < roj> ??wizardry
22:45 < OCTOTROG> wizardry[1/2]: Makes spellcasting less likely to fail. Comes in staff and ring form. Stacks, but not very well. Vehumet grants a similar boost to {destructive spells}, which stacks well with regular wizardry.

23:07 < apoch> The Tournament is not about winning. Jeeez
23:07 <@ZureaL> I haven't won a game since 01.7
23:07 <@ZureaL> 0.17
23:07 < apoch> The tournament is about amounting as many yet another stupid deaths as possible in a two week time period

23:10 < johnstein> ZureaL: I've been harassing the brothers via email and phone. sounds like they are in but still getting confirmation
23:10 < apoch> tumiuti is probably a randart so it's not in the db
23:11 <@ZureaL> johnstein, okay.  We'll put shmup with you guys if that's okay
23:11 < zackoid> ZureaL: you can move me to the ceompetitive team if it helps

02:10 < omnomnOMINOUS> oh it looks like i can't cast most of the powerful spells in the necrobook anyway as a vampire (and i can get similar benefits by going bloodless) so it sounds like pain brand is the obvious choice...

09:21 < advil> kimtrucks: the vaults branch often has an entry-way like that somewhere in the dungeon, it's usually best to try another stairs
09:21 < kimtrucks> advil well it was ambitious to try d13 before lair anyways
09:21 < kimtrucks> so I just backed out and went to Lair
09:21 < advil> ah, that's true :-)

09:22 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck has played 16 games, between 2016-10-31 23:47:59 and 2016-11-03 01:12:53, won 0, high score 146055, total score 315206, total turns 146379, play-time/day 3:16:19, total time 13:05:16.
09:23 < advil> couldn't remember if you'd played before this
09:23 < kimtrucks> nope
09:25 < advil> did you play nethack or anything?
09:26 < kimtrucks> I played a little Dredmor but it annoyed me
09:26 < advil> heh
09:26 < kimtrucks> ??sonja
09:26 < OCTOTROG> sonja[1/3]: Speed 14 kobold with curare and either a draining, venom, or distortion dagger/short sword. Has 3 seperate hits, and knows both blink and emergency teleport self.
09:27 < advil> one suggestion is that you probably don't want to wear a large shield except in very special circumstances, it takes about 25 skill to eliminate penalties, and you're probably getting substantial penalties with just 4
09:27 < advil> I almost never wear large shields except on species that have a bonus for it (troll, formicid, naga)

09:31 < advil> ouch
09:31 < advil> a daeva is not easy anywhere
09:31 < kimtrucks> the Shining One wasn't terribly fond of me, it seems
09:31 < advil> surprised there would be one on abyss 2
09:31 < advil> ??daeva
09:32 < OCTOTROG> daeva[1/1]: Very rare monster summoned by TSO as pets or punishers. Can also be seen occasionally in the Abyss, {holy pan}, Zig holy levels and in a couple of vaults. Spells: Smiting, smiting, smiting.
09:33 < kimtrucks> at least Abyss had more hidey-holes
09:34 < kimtrucks> seems a lot of the rune branches deliberately try to generate wide open spaces to make your life even harder

09:44 < kimtrucks> oof
09:44 < kimtrucks> I gotta admit dying with my +14 trog mace hurt
09:44 < kimtrucks> but yeah most of my roguelike experience is with roguelike-likes like FTL or Spelunky
09:44 < kimtrucks> I guess the fact that I was playing 868-HACK recently might help
10:00 < advil> you seem to be doing pretty well
10:00 < advil> sometimes people just don't make it past like D:6 for 30 games
10:02 < zackoid> advil: did you see the FSIM results on that +14 dire flail kim had?
10:02 < advil> nop
10:02 < advil> e
10:03 < zackoid> it was an out-of-date trunk copy on DBRO, but the only monster i could find where a +9 great mace of flaming was better than a +14 dire flail of flaming was dispater.
10:03 < zackoid> even with 27 fighting and 20 maces.
10:03 < zackoid> which makes...no sense to me
10:03 < advil> hmm
10:03 < advil> strange
10:03 < advil> gotta go though, I'll think about it
10:03 < zackoid> either it's a bug or it's because the DF has a 0.6 speed

11:23 < kimtrucks> ??iashol
11:23 < OCTOTROG> ru[1/8]: Ru grants great power to adherents who renounce the world by making sacrifices. Worshippers are periodically offered a choice of three sacrifices, and gain piety for accepting one of them. The offers are refreshed more slowly if you ignore them, more quickly with faith. Removing faith causes the next sacrifice to be delayed with no piety loss.
11:24 < zackoid> there are a couple gods that were tested but never made it into a proper release in there.  and one who did but then was removed!
11:24 < kimtrucks> oh, Iashol is now Ru. got it
11:24 < zackoid> guess they fixed the uskayaw / ukayaw problem.
11:26 < odiv> "I, asshole" was the idea I think?

12:58 < OCTOTROG> the shining one[1/10]: One of three 'good gods'. Provides a number of passive favors as well as active abilities later. Enjoys killing of evil creatures, and forbids poison, evil/unholy magic or items, attacking distracted or sleeping intelligent creatures, and cannibalism.
12:58 < kimtrucks> ??trog
12:58 < OCTOTROG> trog[1/9]: God of anger and violence. Expects followers to kill constantly in his name; hates magic and all who practice it.
12:58 < kimtrucks> well this helps explain why TSO hated me so

13:04 < odiv> :(
13:04 < lukano> i was mostly tab-mashing
13:04 < lukano> not going to get invested in a game before the tourney starts tomorrow
13:05 < lukano> er. uh. it hasnt started already has it?
13:06 < odiv> It's over.
13:06 < zackoid> !!time
13:06 < odiv> We won!
13:06 < odiv> yay!
13:06  * odiv hands out PARTICIPANT ribbons.
13:06 < OCTOTROG> Time: Nov 03, 2016, 05:06:57 PM, UTC. The 2016 0.19 tournament starts in 1 day, 2 hours, 53 minutes and 2 seconds.
13:07 < lukano> these must be scores from last tourney then, on teh .19 page?
13:07 < zackoid> they'll get wiped
13:07 < lukano> ah, k
13:07 < kimtrucks> so if I'
13:08 < kimtrucks> m mid-run when it begins, will I have to start a new run?
13:08 < lukano> hey kim you need to add your #TEAMCAPTAIN apoch line to the top of your rc file for .19
13:08 < lukano> yes you will
13:08 < zackoid> only games that are started after the start time count for the tournament.
13:08 < zackoid> kimtrucks: if you are worried that you'll be in the middle of a great run you could play trunk, which is a seperate save
13:09 < zackoid> i doubt they have divereged much yet
13:09 < kimtrucks> lukano very first line 
13:09 < kimtrucks> #TEAMCAPTAIN apoch
13:09 < kimtrucks> or...?
13:09 < lukano> yup
13:10 < zackoid> kimtrucks: while you're in there add autofight_stop = 60 
13:11 < kimtrucks> which does...?
13:11 < zackoid> it makes tab not work when you hit 60% of HP
13:11 < kimtrucks> I actually don't use tab
13:11 < kimtrucks> I hit dir keys for every whack
13:11 < odiv> is there supposed to be a space after #?
13:11  * odiv checks.
13:11 < lukano> probably a good idea to not use tab to start
13:11 < lukano> I dont have a space in my rc line from last tourney
13:11 < zackoid> you should, and with a high stop setting.  that way it forces you to think when you're taking damage, instead of waiting until you're nearly dead
13:12 < lukano> also, you know about 'o' for autoexplore, right kimtrucks?
13:12 < kimtrucks> mhm
13:12 < kimtrucks> my current setup for starting a run is:
13:12 < kimtrucks> hit M, cc ee a b gg hh
13:12 < zackoid> there are times when you shouldn't use tab to fight, like when positioning is important or you need to target a specific enemy
13:12 < zackoid> but you should play much slower when that situation occurs
13:12 < kimtrucks> then o o o o o o o o interspaced with smacking people with my mace
13:13 < kimtrucks> last run I had a level with a 'spiral' layout with a monster visible in next ring of spiral, always
13:13 < kimtrucks> had to explore entire level manually

14:38 < OCTOTROG> armor ~ armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.

15:03 < roj> what's the avep calc?
15:03 < roj> I'm trying to figure out the str I should have for plate armor to avoid as much penalty as possible
15:03 < roj> ??avep
15:03 < OCTOTROG> avep ~ aevp[1/1]: Adjusted body armour evasion penalty. Affects spell success, melee and missile accuracy. Its value is [(2/5) * er^2 / (str+3)] * [45 - armour_skill]/45.
15:04 < zackoid> it's !!aevp but also that is only part of the penalty and trying to answer that question scientifically may have resulted in my hospitilization
15:04 < roj> heh
15:04 < roj> !! avep
15:04 < roj> !!avep
15:04 < zackoid> how much strengths you got
15:04 < roj> 21. 
15:05 < roj> I've seen "have enc at 3*Encumbrance.
15:05 < zackoid> enc?
15:05 < roj> str, sorry.
15:05 < zackoid> nah that's way too much
15:05 < roj> but that seems bananas, 64 str.
15:05 < zackoid> ??plate armour
15:05 < zackoid> i think it's 18
15:06 < zackoid> 21 is enough, especially if you are not casting spellz
15:06 < zackoid> the normal suggestion is around 1 over encumbrance rating
15:06 < roj> its 18
15:06 < roj> But I see a bunch of 'could not attack due to armor'
15:06 < roj> And then I headbutt them to death.
15:07 < roj> I'm seeing ho wmuch I like riposte
15:07 < zackoid> armour skill will bring down those blocked attacks
15:07 < zackoid> riposte isn't something to build around i think, just a nice bonus
15:09 < roj> Nod. I don't know what to build around anyway.
15:09 < zackoid> HUGE SWORDS
15:10 < roj> I just like the idea of more than one counterattack.

19:15 < Kimtruck> ??staff
19:15 < OCTOTROG> staff[1/3]: (staves; +5 acc / 5 dam / 1.2 base delay / 0.6 min delay). There are four kinds: energy (negates {spell hunger} and can be e(v)oked to convert food into MP), wizardry (reduces spell failure chances), power (grants extra MP), and enhancer (makes a specific school of magic more powerful, often granting thematic melee powers and resistances).
19:15 < Kimtruck> ??rod
19:16 < OCTOTROG> rod[1/4]: Contains a spell. Wield and Evoke to cast it. Uses an internal mana pool which recharges gradually over time, even if not wielded. A scroll of recharging increases a rod's limit and enchantment by 1d2 (up to a max of 17 and +9 respectively), and (always) recharges its mp to full. See {rods} for a list of types.

19:59 < Hildebrand> ??lair
19:59 < OCTOTROG> lair[1/2]: Accessed from the main dungeon somewhere between levels 8 and 11. Six levels deep (eight in 0.18-). The lair is full of "natural" critters such as rats, snakes, and yaks. One of Swamp/Shoals and one of Snake/Spider appears there, as well as Slime, and there is a relatively hard vault on Lair:8. The petting zoo of Crawl, if petting zoos had hydras.

20:16 < Hildebrand> ugh
20:16 < Hildebrand> fucking entropy weavers
20:16 < Hildebrand> couldnt get away from it
20:16 < Kimtruck> :(
20:16 < Hildebrand> ??corrosion
20:16 < OCTOTROG> acid[1/3]: May cause you to receive a level of the debuff "Corr". When something attempts to corrode you, it has a Corr_level/(Corr_level+9) chance to fail. Each level of Corr reduces your AC by 4 and gives -4 slaying. Goes away after enough time has passed. Corr(-4) means -4 slaying/-4 AC. Monsters get a non-stacking -8 ac, and have a 1/3 chance to be corroded when splashed.
20:16 < Hildebrand> thats what makes them hurt
20:18 < zackoid> they are fast too i think
20:18 < zackoid> !!gamesuntilwin Hildebrand
20:18 < Hildebrand> ??entropy weaver
20:18 < OCTOTROG> entropy weaver[1/2]: Casts entropic weave in 0.18 and chants word of entropy in 0.17. Has four melee attacks and comes with a small band of spiders in order to capitalize on your corrosion. Spawns in Spider, Vaults, and Depths. New in 0.17.

20:19 < OCTOTROG> Casts entropic weave in 0.18 and chants word of entropy in 0.17. Has four melee attacks and comes with a small band of spiders in order to capitalize on your corrosion. Spawns in Spider, Vaults, and Depths. New in 0.17. / Applies 4 stacks of corrosion, each one giving -4 AC and -4 slaying. rCorr applies to each stack separately, giving an expected result of 2 stacks. The normal
20:19 < OCTOTROG> stepdowned chance of applying corrosion to already-corroded players also applies, so you can end up with fewer stacks even without rCorr. Takes 30 aut to cast.
20:19 < zackoid> Hildebrand: did you die with a rune before you won, do you remember?
20:19 < zackoid> i feel like that will be a milestone for everyone
20:19 < Hildebrand> i think i did
20:20 < zackoid> !!gamesuntilrune Hildebrand 
20:20 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand had 9 games before their first rune.
20:20 < zackoid> huh that worked
20:20 < Hildebrand> see :)
20:20 < Kimtruck> I'm looking forward to be saddened by dying with a rune
20:20 < Kimtruck> let's see how it deals with null
20:20 < Kimtruck> !!gamesuntilrune Kimtruck
20:20 < OCTOTROG> No games with a rune for $(name-fix ${*}).
20:20 < zackoid> once you can get a rune you can win, just a matter of learning to be scared.
20:21 < zackoid> because your first run is probably going to be very lucky (by definition) and you will feel like a goddess and then splat in vaults
20:21 < Hildebrand> there are only a few mobs that truely scare me as a mibe
20:22 < Hildebrand> entropy weaver, 27 headed hydra, and i think it was a high level saint roka
20:22 < zackoid> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzmpXz5d2z0
20:22 < Kimtruck> well I've gotten to experience Abyss. How does Abyss rank vs Vaults?
20:22 < apoch> I think Abyss is harder than Vaults
20:23 < zackoid> they're very different, though both can go bad in a hurry.  abyss has probably the highest variance of any branch and it is usually just running around but can get insanely bad quickly.  vaults is mostly about getting locked in bad places.
20:23 < zackoid> abyss is unlike any area because you should mostly just keep moving, not fight things
20:23 < Hildebrand> zackoid, they kinda changed that
20:24 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Cudgeler (L4 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, blasted by an orc priest (divine providence) on D:3, with 78 points after 1750 turns and 0:06:14. [cbro+]
20:24 < Hildebrand> you kinda have to kill now to get the exit to spawn
20:24 < zackoid> yeah though unless you are high level you still shouldn't, mostly
20:24 < apoch> ugh
20:24 < zackoid> but that's true.
20:24 < zackoid> Kimtruck: vaults has these lovely fellows called wardens who lock all the doors on you.
20:24 < apoch> locking the doors is fine, the problem is you're locked in with them and a bunch of assholes
20:25 < zackoid> yes and sometimes they have branded bardiches.  or titans.
20:25 < Hildebrand> like v5
20:25 < Hildebrand> wardens and titans just cry
20:25 < zackoid> Kimtruck: also if you do make it do vaults do not go down to vaults:5
20:25 < Hildebrand> titans are another that make me cry
20:25 < Hildebrand> ^^ cannot stress enough
20:28 < OCTOTROG> Manman (L12 MiBe) killed the ghost of Hildebrand the Severer, a journeyman MiBe of Trog. (Lair:5) [cbro+]

20:38 < zackoid> there.
20:40 < zackoid> apoch: in my experience, DsCK is like startscum: the game.
20:40 < zackoid> if you don't get good XNG early it is time to restart because you are dead.
20:48 < apoch> xng?
20:49 < zackoid> xom rng
20:51 < apoch> ah
21:13 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L23 VpEn) killed the Enchantress. (Depths:4) [cbro+]
21:17 < zackoid> that's a scary one for --En
21:24 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah i'm glad i chose to get haunt earlier
21:26 < omnomnOMINOUS> because i had like 0% chance to affect with hexes, and like 10% with agony
21:30 < omnomnOMINOUS> still don't know where i'm going to get my 3rd rune... not sure if vaults 5, slime, or abyss will be easiest
21:30 < OCTOTROG> osuadh (L15 MiMo) killed the ghost of kimtruck the Bludgeoner, a journeyman MiBe of Trog. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
21:38 < odiv> scoring pages are up
21:39 < Hildebrand> how finalized are the teams?
21:40 < Hildebrand> kinda looks like we need 2 for competitive
21:48 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L24 VpEn) reached level 5 of the Depths. (Depths:5) [cbro+]
21:48 <@ZureaL> Hildebrand, teams aren't finalized until 4 days (I think?) after tourney start
21:49 < johnstein> might be more days too
21:49 < johnstein> but 4 is a good target
21:50 <@ZureaL> !time

21:51 < Hildebrand> so we just need to convince two more people to play then we have 4 full teams
21:51 <@ZureaL> yes
21:51 <@ZureaL> I know zackoid and I are both willing to go to the competative team
22:01 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L24 VpEn) killed Roxanne. (Swamp:2) [cbro+]
22:02 < OCTOTROG> graemelion (L5 MiBe) killed the ghost of roj the Ruffian, an amateur TrMo. (D:3) [cbro+]
22:02 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L24 VpEn) killed Bai Suzhen. (Swamp:3) [cbro+]
22:03 < omnomnOMINOUS> haunt is so good
22:03 < odiv> is it still?
22:03 < odiv> I remember it being like stupid nerfed
22:03 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L24 VpEn) killed the ghost of Firecrotchwizard the Warrior, an adept MiFi of Okawaru. (Swamp:3) [cbro+]
22:03 < odiv> a couple times. Some directly, some indirectly.
22:03 < omnomnOMINOUS> i dunno how it was before but it's still pretty good
22:04 < odiv> Well they nerfed summons pretty hard so they couldn't attack out of your los
22:04 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L24 VpEn) killed Nikola. (Swamp:3) [cbro+]
22:04 < omnomnOMINOUS> ohhhh yes that is true
22:05 < odiv> and they nerfed haunt at least once so that they would disappear when the thing you haunted died and also something else I think?
22:05 < omnomnOMINOUS> yes that is also true
22:05 < odiv> But if it still owns, then that's good
22:07 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah i guess the main thing it does for me is surround and distract monsters; it won't kill powerful uniques by itself but it lets me get in and stab
22:08 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L24 VpEn) entered the Pits of Slime. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
22:13 < zackoid> i've never tried it because the monster set is so unimpressive and i'm not a big fan of necro, but even if it was just butterflies surrounding an enemy is super good
22:19 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L24 VpEn) reached level 5 of the Pits of Slime. (Slime:5) [cbro]
22:27 < omnomnOMINOUS> ok slime pits is too scary
22:27 < zackoid> aww no TRJ stab?
22:28 < omnomnOMINOUS> i tried, but didn't finish it off in one stab

22:28 < omnomnOMINOUS> and it spit out 11 jellies
22:30 < zackoid> heh stabbing is probably not a good idea 
22:30 < zackoid> simulacra?
22:30 < zackoid> do you even get corpses in slime?
22:34 < omnomnOMINOUS> no corpses
22:39 < omnomnOMINOUS> theoretically i could use kiku's corpse drop but it might get fiddly
22:39 < omnomnOMINOUS> i'm going to see what the new infestation spell is like
22:42 < zackoid> i meant corpse drop yeah
22:43 < omnomnOMINOUS> yes, you can get corpses in slime with the corpse drop ability

01:28 < odiv> woo
01:28 < johnstein> neckro, Kramell might be announcing milestones for the tourney, so you may need to modify Octotrog to relay from that bot
01:29 < johnstein> or I can just announce ALL cbro milestones in #octolog. 
01:33 < omnomnOMINOUS> i think i'm about to die

01:37 < omnomnOMINOUS> welp, that's okay! now we can start tourney games ^_^
01:37 < omnomnOMINOUS> i think maybe i needed to get freezing cloud or something; i could deal with every other monster except orbs of fire
01:39 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L1 VpEn) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
01:42 < odiv> I don't think freezing cloud deals well with oofs

04:06 < Rotatell> johnstein: Webtiles server restarted.
04:09 < johnstein> !time
04:09 < OCTOTROG> Time: Nov 04, 2016, 08:09:38 AM, UTC. The 2016 0.19 tournament starts in 11 hours, 50 minutes and 21 seconds.
04:12 <@laceratedsky> thanks johnstein ;)
04:12 <@laceratedsky> btw you do have multiple administering your CBRO server right?  it's not just you?
04:13 < johnstein> it's just me
04:13 < johnstein> I'm also backup for cao now
04:13 <@laceratedsky> jesus christ man
04:13 < johnstein> they basically run themselves honestly. just need to do the version upgrades
04:14 < johnstein> every few months. and the occasional password reset
04:14 <@laceratedsky> so listen, I will happily do restarts or whatever whenever you need help
04:14 < johnstein> I want to move cbro off of where it is. it's running RILLY OLD ubuntu
04:15 < johnstein> and I've got a few other non-crawl things on it, like ZNC and Mumble, and the occasional game servers for the family
04:15 <@laceratedsky> right
04:15 <@laceratedsky> VPS = mystery bag of random shit
04:15 < johnstein> but I'd like to move it to its own server, get a few other people to help run it, and maybe possibly set up a tip jar for part of the running, especially now that cszo is gone and cbro is basically the biggest NA server
04:15 <@laceratedsky> pretty sure I still have a 7 days to die server set up somewhere
04:15 < johnstein> heh
04:16 <@laceratedsky> well, consider my name in the hat then
04:16 <@laceratedsky> don't care about tips or whatever
04:16 <@laceratedsky> but I do this for a living, and DCSS is a worthy cause ;)
04:18 < johnstein> I don't want to make any money or anything. just offset some of the costs. I had to double the capacity (maxed it out at ramnode) last tourney. and while I could probalby downgrade a bit for a few slow months between tournaments, it's probably busy enough to just leave it maxed out
04:19 < johnstein> I'd really like to set up a docker instance (there's one in partial development) and try to franchise the model out better, which would really lend itself to others helping more. esp if there were some affordable scalable options that would just auto-adjust to compensate for load when it gets busy again
04:19 <@laceratedsky> how much the server running you per month?
04:19 < johnstein> $48 now. it's the max openvz option at ramnode for atlanta
04:20 <@laceratedsky> oh that
04:20 < johnstein> was $20. well was $10 when no one knew about it
04:20 <@laceratedsky> s not too bad at all

04:20 < johnstein> RAM is 4GB
04:20 < johnstein> 4 cores
04:20 < johnstein> 135 GB
04:20 < johnstein> not really that big
04:22 <@laceratedsky> nope, not at all
04:22 <@laceratedsky> kinda cool actually that it's so small
04:25 < Rotatell> johnstein: Webtiles server restarted.

04:37 < johnstein> neckro, for now, Rotatelljr is announcing ALL milestones, so you probably shouldn't add Kramell yet. I will likely set up something similar for cao/Henzell when I shut it off for ##crawl too (and let Kramell take over)

10:55 < odiv> well we all know you're not ADDING anything to the discussion.
10:55 < johnstein> so let me know if announcements are screwy
10:56 < johnstein> trying an experiment in ##crawl using Kramin's relay bot. meant I had to mod some stuff to keep octotrog working smoothly
11:02 < odiv> ok
11:02 < odiv> are you putting everything through another channel?
11:02 < odiv> or are you scraping from Kramin?
11:03 < odiv> Kramell?
11:05 < johnstein> Kramell reads the log and milestone files directly from the server
11:05 < johnstein> then applies regex  filtering
11:06 < johnstein> the idea is to funnel all the data through one location to simplify keeping everything consistent
11:06 < johnstein> and to only impact one person. not every server admin

11:26 < Kimtruck> oh shush you are not worse than me
11:26 < Kimtruck> you got to Shoals 2
11:26 < Kimtruck> I saw Shoals and then nopped on out
11:27 < roj> "You tried Shoals and failed?" "I tried and died"
11:28 < odiv> Ice caves are rough.
11:28 < odiv> can be, anyway.
11:28 < zackoid> shoals is not categorically tougher than spider.
11:28 < zackoid> i would grade it as tougher on average, and it's harder to understand what is going on for a new player.
11:28 < roj> You're doing amazing, imho, is what I was saying.
11:29 < roj> And i totally win on d1 deaths.
11:29 < zackoid> guess you guys are going to have to race for games until first rune
11:29 < Kimtruck> very kind of you. we'll just agree to disagree
11:29 < roj> I should try the guy that died in ice cave and shoals. I think that was my merman... uh... some minor caster class.

11:33 < roj> I do like troll monk.
11:33 < roj> I dream of being good enough to get him far enough to worship teh jelly god.
11:33 < zackoid> ah you went in directly.  that is a noob trap.
11:33 < roj> I am a noob.
11:33 < zackoid> you don't want to go in any of the lair branches immediately
11:33 < roj> I explore caves as they are encountered, as the founding fathers played their primative paper dungeons.
11:33 < johnstein> I don't know how you learn that. cept by dying
11:34 < roj> Left first search forever.
11:34 < roj> Yeah. I've stopped doing that.
11:34 < zackoid> that troll of jiyva article on the wiki is also a noob trap.
11:34 < roj> I will try the first floor a little and leave now.
11:34 < roj> I am super good at noob traps.
11:34 < Kimtruck> my reaction to every cave was: "huh. that looks dangerous. no thank you."
11:34 < zackoid> you don't want to do even the first floor, because slime is a lair branch and a single acid blod or azure jelly will eat your face.
11:35 < zackoid> plus mara could be standing on the other side of a lair branch door.
11:35 < johnstein> I'm still nervous of ice caves and volcanoes. though I don't think they are as bad as my mind thinks they are
11:35 < johnstein> I just had a few bad experiences
11:35 < Kimtruck> yeaaah it'll take a lot of convincing to get me inside a volcano
11:35 < zackoid> TIMED portals you can enter, like ice caves.  although a lot of time the correct move is just to turn around and leave, they'll never jump on the first turn.
11:35 < johnstein> ?!effing Mara
11:35 < OCTOTROG> No definition for {effing Mara}
11:36 < Kimtruck> ??Mara
11:36 < zackoid> volcanos aren't so bad, i think ice caves are much worse.  the hard part of volcanoes is just the eruptions.
11:36 < OCTOTROG> mara[1/5]: Lord of Illusions! Mara creates two identical (stats, spells, weapon, armour) clones of himself, summons a hostile illusion (based on you), casts bolt of fire, blinks, and casts {Mislead} in 0.13 and older.

11:40 < roj> And stuff like sewer and such that are closing, jump in if I'm handling the level they're on?
11:40 < zackoid> guess that's deprecated or something.
11:41 < roj> Kimtruck:  in tournament terms, you're kicking my ass! I looked at averages and sum games to give you a 'but in a tournament, I'd be better!' joshing... but no.
11:41 < zackoid> roj: it's not exactly rune because like orc can appear before lair but you don't want to do orc first (anymore).  but yeah if it's timed (it'll announce when you first enter the level with the portal) you should go in, just don't think that you need to complete the portal or even take a step forward
11:41 < roj> Can I be on Kim's team, please?
11:41 < roj> What do you mean? Do the portals stay open after you come out?
11:41 < roj> I thought they collapsed behind you.
11:41 < roj> I haven't seen many.
11:42 < zackoid> you can only enter once, but you can go back out the way you came in usually.  or at least there will be an exit right next to you, i forget exactly
11:42 < Kimtruck> yeah generally there will be a tele nearby if the exit itself has collapsed
11:42 < roj> Right, oh, you get poinst for entering, so even if I don't want to do it, I should try to wander in and back out.
11:42 < zackoid> but often i'll enter say an ice cave and take two steps forward and then just nope out
11:42 < Kimtruck> or at least I've always seen one within 5-10 tiles
11:43 < roj> Yeah, same on the two sewers or snake pits or whatever, exit was always right there.
11:43 < roj> I need ot get out of a must finish all floors, must explore all branches mindset I have.
11:43 < zackoid> i don't enter branches for the points because it's tedious, but some versions of the same portal are much easier than others so it doesn't hurt to check
11:43 < zackoid> EXCEPTION: the labryinth
11:43 < roj> What are your rules of thumbs for attempting a branch?
11:43 < roj> Obv it depends on the branch.
11:43 < zackoid> there is only one exit from a lab, and it's guarded by a pretty tough monster who happens to be standing on a pile of items he can pick up and use
11:43 < Kimtruck> zackoid, exception insofar that it is exceptionally brutal...?
11:43 < roj> Like if you pass the easiest you'll turn back sooner.
11:44 < roj> Well, at least that monster is pretty.
11:44 < zackoid> BUT the lab has the best loot by far.
11:44 < zackoid> roj, this is the basic framework of a dive order:
11:44 < zackoid> ??hyperelliptic
11:44 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot
11:45 < roj> Where should you be before trying lair?
11:45 < roj> AS soon as you see it?
11:45 < zackoid> those are the levels you get to before moving to the next target, basically.
11:45 < roj> Ah, do lair before getting to D12.
11:45 < Kimtruck> so get to d:12, then backtrack (probably/definitely?) to lair
11:45 < zackoid> i usually will do D:10 or whenever i hit an unseen horror or something scary.
11:45 < zackoid> Kimtruck: no the opposite
11:45 < Kimtruck> oh sorry misread
11:46 < zackoid> it's confusingly written.  
11:46 < roj> What's S:3?
11:46 < Kimtruck> Swamp or Shoals or... the other?
11:46 < Kimtruck> Spider
11:46 < roj> Snorc.
11:46 < zackoid> there are 4 lair branches, in any given game you'll get 2 of them
11:46 < Kimtruck> so get to level 3 of one of the Ss. I think the level value might be out of date as of 0.19?
11:46 < Kimtruck> ??shoals
11:46 < OCTOTROG> shoals[1/4]: Lair branch that can replace Swamp. It has tides, merfolk (including javelineers and aquamancers), {kraken}, snapping turtles, sea snakes, cyclopes, and harpies. It is 4 levels deep and has the barnacled rune at the end.
11:47 < zackoid> confusingly there is a 5th lair branch that also starts with S but that doesn't count (slime, don't do slime without my express written approval)
11:47 < zackoid> Kimtruck: no that's intentional and the most important concept of that dive order
11:47 < Kimtruck> I thought that one of the Ss had been dropped to 2 levels
11:47 < zackoid> the two lair branches are rougly equal in difficulty, and on both the rune level (the 4th) is much harder than the rest
11:47 < roj> Don't do slim? But.. but troll monk with jellied pals.
11:47 < Kimtruck> or am I thinking of some other branch?
11:47 < Kimtruck> like Orc?
11:47 < odiv> Orc
11:47 < zackoid> so you put off getting the runes, because starting the second one is easier than finishing the 1st
11:47 < odiv> Orc is 2 levels.
11:48 < zackoid> so buy the time you've done 6 levels of lair branch, you're stronger than after you've done 3.
11:48 < roj> Okay, so hyper elliptic means "lair, up to 2 or 3" when it says lair, and "lair to 3" when it says S:3.
11:49 < zackoid> no it means to end of the branch when it does not specify
11:49 < zackoid> so to write it out in a less confusing way
11:49 < roj> Please.
11:49 < zackoid> D:1 to D:10 -> Lair to 6 -> D:11 and D:12 -> orc to 2 -> D:13 to D:15
11:50 < zackoid> then (easier lair branch for your character) to 3 -> harder lair branch to 3 -> level 4 of whichever lair branch you felt like to get a rune
11:50 < zackoid> to means including.
11:51 < Kimtruck> !!time
11:51 < OCTOTROG> Time: Nov 04, 2016, 03:51:07 PM, UTC. The 2016 0.19 tournament starts in 4 hours, 8 minutes and 52 seconds.
11:51 < zackoid> shmup: we should add a dive guide to your stuff.
11:51 < Kimtruck> SO CLOSE
11:51 < zackoid> it's too wordy for irc bots
11:51 < roj> Ah, so Lair has tow sub branches that contain runes. That is the part I was missing.
11:51 < zackoid> it has 3, heh.
11:51 < roj> Okay.
11:51 < zackoid> lemme find the map
11:52 < roj> Yeah, i though they all went off of the dungeon, so when you said 'branch to 3' i headr 'lair to 3' since all branches were lairs in my head an yeesh.
11:52 < roj> So, thank you.
11:53 < zackoid> http://i.imgur.com/7yRZ8Pz.png
11:53 < zackoid> that.
11:54 < zackoid> though that has more stuff than you really need to know
11:54 < Kimtruck> hah
11:54 < Kimtruck> the Abyss treatment made me laugh
11:55 < roj> I need to know everything!
11:56 < zackoid> yeah i love the abyss part.
11:56 < odiv> that's a cool pic, thanks.
11:58 < odiv> ??salt
11:58 < OCTOTROG> desolation[1/1]: A portal vault added in 0.19, featuring open areas with vision blocking clouds and non-living enemies.
11:58 < zackoid> here's the version without pleasingfungus' quality edit: http://i.imgur.com/Ens4iz2.png
11:58 < roj> I will keep this map forever.
11:58 < roj> I will be an heirloom of my family.
11:59 < roj> Where do the random branches show up?
11:59 < roj> Anywhere?
12:00 < Kimtruck> ??random branch
12:00 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled random_branch in my learndb.
12:00 < Kimtruck> ??volcano
12:00 < OCTOTROG> volcano[1/5]: A timed portal vault ("a dark tunnel") that shows up in Lair and Orc. Contains red monsters, red loot, and a red Volcano that explodes in red clouds every now and then. Enjoy your red, don't forget your red urn!
12:01 < Kimtruck> apparently not?
12:01 < zackoid> it depends on the branch
12:01 < zackoid> sewer is very early, wizlabs are only late
12:01 < zackoid> bazaars can be anywhere
12:02 < zackoid> your average game probably has <1 timed portal
12:02 < zackoid> calling them branches is confusing.
12:11 < odiv> Hey, does someone with enough scrollback want to check what I asked johnstein about if he was contacted ahead of the tournament announcement re:dates?
12:11 < odiv> I forget exactly what I asked and what he said and I can't go back that far, apparently.
12:14 < odiv> hey TheNoid
12:14 < TheNoid> Hello odiv.
12:15 <@shmup> yeah zackoid that'd be nice
12:19 < Kimtruck> heya noid
12:22 < Kimtruck> heya slitherrr
12:23 < TheNoid> Howdy.
12:24 < johnstein> odiv: I have logs. dpeg also pinged me. I think we just had a small miscommunication
12:24 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L1 OpTm) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
12:25 < johnstein> I think I interpreted your question as, do they try to work around my schedule and contact me ahead of time to find a good time period
12:26 < johnstein> and the answer is no, they don't ask if a time period works well for me. they just assume
12:26 < odiv> Yeah, I didn't mean to be accusatory or anything.
12:26 < johnstein> but since I'm in crawl-dev all the time I'm usually keeping tabs and when they finally nail down a date they share and then I work with them to refine if I think it needs tweaked.
12:27 < johnstein> for this tourney I was pretty firmly insisting that cbro can't handle the cao load too
12:27 < johnstein> which took a few rounds of discussion for that to sink in
12:27 < johnstein> and I got access to cao to help get it back and running
12:28 < johnstein> so there's decent communication I think. but servers *are* kinda treated as a commodity that will magically handle everything thrown at it :p
12:28 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Insei (L4 OpTm), slain by an orc priest (a +0 dagger) on D:3, with 86 points after 1855 turns and 0:03:44. [cbro+]
12:28 < johnstein> so when I get the logs and we re read them, it might end up I was feeling a bit taken for granted that day :p
12:29 < odiv> It was a super short conversation too.
12:29 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L1 OpMo) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
12:29 < odiv> I think I was like, "Hey do you get a heads up before the tournament annoucement?" and you were like "no"
12:29 < johnstein> yep
12:29 < odiv> But my memory is sometimes not 100%
12:29 < odiv> SHOCK

12:42 <@slitherrr> also hey Kimtruck and TheNoid 
12:43 < zackoid> CAO is back.
12:43 < johnstein> ??is cao down
12:43 < OCTOTROG> 1 minutes, 52 seconds since last activity (cao)
12:44 <@slitherrr> oh because you said something about cbro not handling cao load
12:44 <@slitherrr> i guess it was an outage, not a removal
12:45 < odiv> Yeah, some maintenance needed to happen I think so he wanted to make sure it was taken care of?
12:46 < odiv> Though I
12:46 < odiv> 'm not 100% sure so maybe I shouldn't talk?

18:52 < OCTOTROG> shield[1/5]: Wearing a shield gives you a chance to block all damage from some attacks, including arrows, melee, and some spells. Shields prevent off-hand attacks, and until you have enough skill they also slow your melee attacks and make it harder to cast spells.
18:52 < greynaab> ??shield[2
18:52 < OCTOTROG> shield[2/5]: You need 4/15/25 skill to eliminate evasion, melee speed, and casting penalties for bucklers/shields/large shields for normal races, 5.6/21/- for kobolds and halflings, 7.2/-/- for spriggans, 2.4/9/15 for nagas, centaurs, and formicids, -/9/15 for trolls and ogres.

01:48 < Kramin> also MarvinPA didn't want grey text
01:48 < johnstein> I saw that go away
01:48 < Kramin> I changed it but I'm not sure
01:48 < Kramin> I think it should stay
01:49 < johnstein> I'm used to Octotrog's coloring in here
01:49 < johnstein> there's some issues, but in general I like it
01:49 < johnstein> the gray was nice too
01:49 < johnstein> easy to visually filter it out
01:49 < Kramin> I dont think the average user can be bothered setting up the stuff you need client side to do that
01:49 < johnstein> what was his rationale?

01:50 < Kramin> ??soft ignore
01:50 < OCTOTROG> softignore[1/6]: Bots too annoying? If you have the right client, try this:
01:50 < Kramin> which is true
01:50 < odiv> the inverse is also true, right?
01:50 < Kramin> yeah...
01:51 < johnstein> how can people do that?
01:51 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L4 HEAr) killed Terence. (D:2) [cbro+]
01:51 < odiv> though perhaps the onus is on the change to be justified or whatever.
01:51 < Kramin> yeah
01:51 < Kramin> I can change it back if you discuss in crawl-dev and come to some consensus
01:51 < johnstein> it's not coloring them
01:51 < johnstein> it's lack of color to de-emphasize them so you can easily see the convo at a glance. hmmm
01:51 < Kramin> heh
01:52 < Kramin> technicality :P
01:52 < johnstein> next time it comes up in dev I'll probably chime in
01:52 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr the Slayer (L20 MiFi), worshipper of Okawaru, demolished by an azure jelly (created by the Royal Jelly) on Slime:4, with 303088 points after 32439 turns and 2:49:55. [cbro+]

01:52 < johnstein> :C
01:52 <@slitherrr> was running away from that bullshit and two squares away
01:52 < Kramin> yeah
01:52 <@slitherrr> then they caught up RIGHT at the stairs

01:52 < OCTOTROG> necKro23 (L9 MiBe) killed the ghost of spe3d0 the Shield-Bearer, a novice VSFi of Okawaru. (D:7) [cbro+]
01:52 < Kramin> I figured I'd do as I was told... for now :P
01:53 < johnstein> sure. it's all about parity for now
01:53 < Kramin> just need to get full control of all the servers before I go rogue
01:53 < Kramin> :P
01:53 < johnstein> heh
01:53 < johnstein> I'll try to work on Henzell at some point. just way too busy
01:53 < Kramin> yeah, all good
01:54 < Kramin> if you want I can reduce cbro's announcements, it's a little bit spammy in crawl
01:54 < Kramin> first day will probably be the worst though
01:54 < johnstein> the great thing about this setup is, I don't have to be involved
01:54 < johnstein> :P
01:54 < OCTOTROG> necKro23 (L10 MiBe) killed Duvessa. (D:7) [cbro+]

15:43 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L3 MiBe) fell down a shaft to D:4. (D:2) [cbro+]
15:43 < zackoid> you will rarely see a shield better than 3AC in any given game, so yes
15:44 < Kimtruck> ??hyperelliptic
15:44 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot
15:44 < zackoid> and a shield is literally useless against OOFS iirc
15:44 < OCTOTROG> ZombieSheep the Protected (L9 MiFi), worshipper of Okawaru, mangled by a cyan ugly thing on D:7, with 2467 points after 5002 turns and 0:12:01. [cbro+]

15:44 < OCTOTROG> valrus (L7 DsGl) became a worshipper of Uskayaw. (Temple) [cbro+]
15:44 < apoch> Done any vault yet?
15:44 < Kimtruck> I'm on Shoals 3, considering whether to backtrack all the way to Spider to avoid going to Shoals 4
15:45 <@ZureaL> can't vault until 1 rune
15:45 < apoch> well if you're picking between the two you might as well just do the one you're almost done with
15:45 < apoch> That's what I'd do and I've died thousands of times.
15:45 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L17 MiBe) reached level 4 of the Shoals. (Shoals:4) [cbro+]
15:45 < OCTOTROG> Almightybob (L18 GrBe) killed Kirke. (Spider:3) [cbro+]
15:45 <@ZureaL> I would do spider:4 before shoals 4
15:45 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L25 MiGl) found a slimy rune of Zot. (Slime:5) [cbro+]
15:45 < apoch> but would you back track from shoals 3 to do it?
15:46 <@ZureaL> if you don't care about move count, sure
15:46 < apoch> good point.
15:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> backtracking is super painless and i do it all the time
15:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> (though i've never been worried about move count)
15:46 < apoch> So I'm currently streaming my crawl games on twitch and I've had several people come in and laugh about miBe
15:46 <@ZureaL> I would finish spider, do vaults to 2 or 3 and then shoals
15:46 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L17 MiBe) killed Ilsuiw. (Shoals:4) [cbro+]
15:47 <@ZureaL> family time...gotta run

15:50 < OCTOTROG> ZombieSheep (L6 MiFi) killed Eustachio. (D:4) [cbro+]
15:50 < apoch> apparently my advice was bad anyway
15:51 < zackoid> i usually do to 3, all of the other, then the first.  but if at any point i feel uncomfortable i switch.
15:51 < Kimtruck> ??bai suzhen
15:51 < OCTOTROG> bai suzhen[1/3]: New (0.19) draconian unique for lategame: mid-point of Lair branches, Elf:$, Vaults, Crypt, Depths. Starts out casting Summon Hydra.

It's a +6 shillelagh that casts radius 1 shatter when you hit something with it, centered on the thing you hit. Won't hit you or break walls. Spellpower scales with melee damage dealt.

15:51 < apoch> apparently so

15:56 < zackoid> Kimtruck: time to run
15:56 < zackoid> vashnia is really bad with her pack
15:57 < zackoid> do you have any scrolls of mapping?
15:57 < apoch> are you saying kim should pack it in?
15:57 < zackoid> it'd be a good time to know if the last stairs is near
15:57 < johnstein> ?@ vashnia
15:57 < johnstein> ??@vashnia
15:57 < OCTOTROG> @vashnia ~ vashnia[1/1]: She patrols Snake with her elite squad of naga sharpshooters. She will readily blink you, herself, and her band around. She also has a Shroud of Golubria, and maintains master archer/portal projectile from her naga sharpshooter upbringing but with more HD for more pain. Don't forget that you can walk away from her and her band, since she has naga speed!
15:57 < johnstein> @??vashnia
15:57 < apoch> oh yeah, she sucks
15:57 < OCTOTROG> Vashnia (N) | Spd: 10 (move: 140%) | HD: 16 | HP: 135-190 | AC/EV: 11/17 | Dam: 25, 7(constrict) | weapons, items, doors, master archer, spellcaster, see invisible | Res: magic(120), poison | Chunks: noxious | XP: 4999 | Sp: spit poison (d23) [!AM, !sil, breath], portal projectile, blink other [emergency], blink allies away, blink away | Sz: Large | Int: human. [cdo]
15:57 < zackoid> good place to find them since they're slow and there were corners to block the shots
15:58 < johnstein> that means she's not slow like nagas?
15:58 < johnstein> or does 140% mean slow?
15:58 < OCTOTROG> ZombieSheep (L8 MiFi) killed Blork the orc. (D:6) [cbro+]
15:58 < zackoid> Kimtruck: you know about stair dancing right?
15:58 < Kimtruck> heard of it
15:58 < zackoid> johnstein: that means 1.4 move delay
15:58 < zackoid> ??stair dancing
15:58 < OCTOTROG> stair dancing[1/1]: The process of dragging enemies up stairs so as to kill them in smaller groups.
15:59 < zackoid> only things adjacent to you come up stairs with you
15:59 < zackoid> so you can repeatedly go up and down to bring only part of a pack with you
15:59 < zackoid> but be careful that constriction can block using stairs
15:59 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L8 MiBe) killed Natasha. (D:5) [cbro+]

16:00 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L8 MiBe) killed Menkaure. (D:5) [cbro+]
16:00 < apoch> nooooo
16:00 < OCTOTROG> ZombieSheep (L9 MiFi) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:7) [cbro+]
16:00 < johnstein> apoch:? cursed?
16:00 < OCTOTROG> ZombieSheep (L9 MiFi) became a worshipper of Okawaru. (Temple) [cbro+]
16:00 < apoch> The idea of not having stair dancing anymore
16:00 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L17 MiBe) killed Vashnia. (Snake:4) [cbro+]
16:00 < zackoid> i don't think item curses exist anymore.
16:00 < johnstein> heh. did you click the link?
16:01 < apoch> after I said nooooo
16:01 < johnstein> heh
16:01 < Kimtruck>  not a good Robin, has no hat
16:01 < omnomnOMINOUS> aw yiss got boots of flying again for shoals
16:02 < OCTOTROG> staplegun (L27 MiFi) killed Cerebov. (Pan) [cbro+]
16:02 < omnomnOMINOUS> wait how would you remove stair dancing? like, everyone follows you upstairs?
16:02 < OCTOTROG> ZombieSheep (L9 MiFi) entered an ossuary. (D:8) [cbro+]
16:02 < omnomnOMINOUS> that would be scary
16:02 < OCTOTROG> staplegun (L27 MiFi) found a fiery rune of Zot. (Pan) [cbro+]
16:02 < OCTOTROG> porpoise (L13 GrFi) became the Champion of Okawaru. (Lair:4) [cbro+]
16:02 < johnstein> or no one follows you
16:02 < apoch> unable to go travel stairs when next to enemies
16:02 < johnstein> or that
16:03 < zackoid> there are proposals to remove both stair dancing and excessive luring, but both would require rewriting major portions of the game
16:03 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L9 MiBe) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:6) [cbro+]
16:03 < zackoid> it's balanced around being able to escape
16:03 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah
16:03 < omnomnOMINOUS> i play mostly stealthy stabbers and such
16:04 < zackoid> ooh unrand of some kind
16:04 < zackoid> dragon mask?
16:04 < zackoid> Kimtruck: go back and get that hat this instance.
16:04 < zackoid> instant.
16:04 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L9 MiBe) killed Blork the orc. (D:6) [cbro+]
16:04 < Kimtruck> zackoid, am minotaur
16:04 < zackoid> it's a hat.
16:04 < zackoid> isn't it?
16:04 < omnomnOMINOUS> so the whole game is like provoking one or two dudes at a time and kiting them backwards
16:04 < apoch> horn 3 can't wear hats
16:05 < zackoid> yeah but mi don't have horns 3 naturally
16:05 < zackoid> only if they get an additional mutation
16:05 < apoch> well then, by all means wear a hat
16:05 < omnomnOMINOUS> ??
16:06 < apoch> do you get the same piety from burning 4 books simultaneously as you would from burning them individually?
16:06 < zackoid> well your resists are solved for the rest of the game kim
16:06 < OCTOTROG> staplegun (L27 MiFi) entered the realm of Lom Lobon. (Pan) [cbro+]
16:06 < omnomnOMINOUS> that is an amazing hat
16:06 < apoch> alchemist?
16:06 < omnomnOMINOUS> can you still headbutt when you're wearing a hat?
16:06 < zackoid> though it looks like they already were
16:06 < zackoid> yes you can headbutt with hats.  i'm pretty sure.
16:06 < apoch> it just crumples up the rim a bit.
16:06 < zackoid> yes you can.
16:07 < zackoid> Kimtruck: you can dump polymorph and ambrosia
16:07 < zackoid> and the great mace of protection
16:07 < OCTOTROG> ZombieSheep (L10 MiFi) killed Grum. (D:9) [cbro+]
16:07 < johnstein> apoch: I think you get piety for each book
16:08 < apoch> too bad you can't see actually piety values
16:08 < apoch> it'd be easy to test
16:08 < zackoid> Kimtruck: if you hadn't guess already, this room has the rune at the end
16:08 < zackoid> so it'll be full of enemies
16:08 < zackoid> very full.
16:08 < Kimtruck> FRICK
16:08 < zackoid> Kimtruck: stop for a bit
16:08 < Kimtruck> least useful tele ever

16:11 < zackoid> you can unstop if that was cause of me.  just better to go make some tea when you get in those kinda situations
16:12 < zackoid> probably the second or third most important skill in crawl is learning to fight away from the black, especially when the black is like 50 monsters in a small room as in the case of rune caults

16:27 < OCTOTROG> rod of clouds[1/2]: Creates clouds in a cone-shaped area. Low power: rain, mist, mephitic clouds; medium power: fire, ice, poison clouds; high power: acid, negative energy, storm clouds.
16:27 < zackoid> ??rod of clouds[2
16:27 < Kimtruck> nice job staplegun!

17:59 < Kimtruck> well this great mace is perfect except that it reduces my int to 1
17:59 < apoch> that's pretty bad

18:01 < johnstein> I usually spend a couple points on int for my Minotaurs. but I don't know how smart that is. I think it's a decent trade off since you have so much str anyway

18:12 < johnstein> since monsters don't pick up items and jellies don't eat them I haven't used a stash
18:13 < johnstein> I just ctrl+f and go
18:13 < johnstein> but I'm not a good enough player to worry about turn count

14:23 < zackoid> Hildebrand: sure
14:24 < sgun_> ??unarmed combat
14:24 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[1/3]: Fighting without a weapon. Base damage is 3 + UC skill (+2 per claws level (so +6 Tr, +2 Gh), +X for forms); delay 1.0 - UC/54.0; +2 to hit.
14:24 < sgun_> ??unarmed combat[2]
14:24 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[2/3]: Base for forms: Normal/Hog 3, Spider 5 (venom), Bat 1, Vampire Bat 2 (vamp), Ice 12 (freezing), Blade 8 + (str + dex) / 3, Statue (6 + str / 3), Dragon 18 + str*2/3, Lich 5 (drain). Form base damage scales with skill, just like normal punches.
14:24 < sgun_> ??unarmed combat[3]
14:24 < OCTOTROG> auxiliary attacks[1/4]: Auxiliary attacks are /extra/ melee attacks using body parts. You can get auxiliary attacks by having hooves, horns, talons, fangs, a beak, or a large muscular tail. Unarmed Combat skill does not affect these. However, if you have Unarmed Combat skill and are not using a shield or two-handed weapon, you do get an offhand punch.
14:25 < sgun_> wish it said how it interacts with having claws for hands

14:25 < OCTOTROG> claws[1/1]: +2 unarmed damage per level and increases {punch} damage. Level 3 chops off hydra heads. The effects of claws are eliminated if you're wearing gloves, though at claws 3 you can't use the slot anyways.
14:25 < zackoid> sgun_: gloves block low level claws, using a shield just negates the off-hand attack
14:26 < advil> a shield is ok I think?
14:26 < sgun_> does unarmed haved an off hand attack by its nature?
14:26 < sgun_> or is that just beastly appendages likes hooves, horns
14:27 < advil> by ok I mean a shield + claws gets the claw bonus for the main attack
14:27 < zackoid> setting off a timed portal because you got shafted :(

14:55 <@slitherrr> are hybrids suddenly bad now?
14:55 < zackoid> imo they are in a bad place
14:56 < zackoid> what's a non-conjuration spell > level 3 that's worth giving up heavy armour for?
14:57 <@slitherrr> statue form
14:57 < advil> my intuition is that normal hybrids are basically ok and it's the weakest species that have probably suffered, but I haven't really played enough to know
14:57 < advil> it's pretty rare to not find a wand of haste if you use acquirement appropriately
14:58 < zackoid> slitherrr: transmutations don't count 'cause they're an all-in thing.
14:58 <@slitherrr> i do agree that the charms school is definitely getting a beating
14:58 <@slitherrr> nah totally not true
14:58 <@slitherrr> statue form can easily be the only transmutation spell you memorize
14:58 <@slitherrr> it doesn't require UC to be interesting
14:59 < zackoid> you can use statue form with weapons but it's a lot of investment and only makes sense if you can't wear armour
14:59 <@slitherrr> unlike dragon, hydra, blade hands, etc
14:59 <@slitherrr> level 6 isn't too crazy. i mean i'm spoiled by ashenzari but it's reasonable with scale-, so peal dragon scales and fire dragon scales
15:00 < advil> I'm not sure I would learn statue form on almost any char :-)
15:00 < advil> in fact I have on exactly one ever
15:00 < zackoid> previously it might make sense to go from heavy->medium armour in the late game for spells, but would you ever do that now?
15:00 <@slitherrr> it's amazing on draconians and ogres, for example, but zackoid's not including those species
15:00 < zackoid> or build around charms/transloc in light armour early and then move up to medium
15:01 < zackoid> statue form felid is both really fun and amazingly powerful
15:01 <@slitherrr> haste definitely made it even better, but torment resistance and poison immunity and big whopping blows is pretty great
15:02 < advil> I think felid is one of those cases where it seems good because untransformed fe is so bad
15:02 < zackoid> best part of statue form is that it's the anti-qb, you only have to hit tab like twice per monster
15:03 < zackoid> 39/47/193 AC/EV/HP is pretty good regardless, though that was back with stoneskin and phase shift.
15:03 < advil> yeah my fe chars have relied on buff spells

15:53 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled invisibility_spell in my learndb.
15:53 < zackoid> ??invisibility
15:53 < OCTOTROG> invisibility[1/5]: If you are invisible, monsters won't shoot ranged attacks at you unless they can see you, or can guess where you are. Monsters get a random fuzz to their aiming point, which might be inaccurate in the first place.
15:53 < OCTOTROG> laceratedsky (L1 MiBe) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
15:53 < zackoid> ??invisibility[2
15:53 < OCTOTROG> invisibility[2/5]: Monsters can guess your position when you are invisible if they knew your position before and you are still within two spaces, if you are in water, or if they are adjacent to you and make a roll based on their intelligence (usually 1 chance in 3). The chance is higher if they are smarter.
15:53 < zackoid> ??invisibility[3
15:53 < OCTOTROG> invisibility[3/5]: Beams shot at you by monsters who can't see you (even if they can sense you) have their accuracy cut in half. Monsters trying to melee you without see invisible and who have correctly guessed your location have their accuracy reduced by 35%.
15:53 < zackoid> ??invisibility[4
15:53 < OCTOTROG> invisibility[4/5]: If you are invisible, and don't have see invisible, you receive -5 to hit (same as amulet of inaccuracy). If you are attacking a monster you cannot see, you receive -6 to hit. (These stack, of course). Your accuracy is no longer reduced when invisible with no SInv in 0.18+.
15:53 < zackoid> ??invisibility[5
15:53 < OCTOTROG> invisibility[5/5]: Fleeing monsters always know which way is away from you whether they can sense you or not.

17:36 <@slitherrr> ??regen
17:36 < OCTOTROG> regeneration[1/8]: Increases the rate at which you regain HP per turn. Regeneration doesn't work when you're {sick}; instead it makes Sickness disappear faster.
17:36 <@slitherrr> ??regen[2
17:36 < OCTOTROG> regeneration[2/8]: The base regeneration rate is your maximum hitpoints / 3. If this number is over 20, then divide the result by two and add ten. For example, 100 max health results in a regen rate of 26. RR accumulates every turn and for every 100 RR you gain, you regenerate 1 hp. For 1 hp per turn, 540 health is needed. For 1 hp per 2 turns, 240.
17:36 <@slitherrr> ??regen[3
17:36 < OCTOTROG> regeneration[3/8]: An amulet or troll leather armour adds 40 to your rr, player mutation 20 per level, and the status effect (spell) 100. What this means is that an amulet of regen or troll leather armour effectively doubles your healing rate (or better) for most characters.

19:19 < zackoid> ask advil about snakebite.  i think you're vastly underrating it, curare is insanely strong.
19:19 < zackoid> ZureaL: well too late now but i would have brought a hydra weapon to swamp since you had all the mace skill still
19:20 <@ZureaL> I had one
19:20 < Hildebrand> ??curare
19:20 < OCTOTROG> curare[1/2]: A type of poison that will slow you, poison you, and do large impact damage (called asphyxiation). To avoid it you can use eXamine to avoid being in any blowgun wielding creature's line of fire for too long. Poison resistance prevents the poisoning and asphyxiation, as well as the slowing (being undead will too).
19:20 < Hildebrand> what about the plate armour zackoid?
19:21 < Hildebrand> ive found a regular plate armour now, would you wear that over the randart?
19:21 < zackoid> not worth it.
19:21 < Hildebrand>  You finish putting on the cursed +1 plate armour "Xiong" {-Tele rCorr Dex+4 SInv}.
19:21 < zackoid> +1 plate is not worth tele, rcorr and dex are basically useless at this point

19:29 < zackoid> Hildebrand: in that case you could just keep training axes, you'll be at mindleay for snakebite quick enough
19:29 < zackoid> or you can swap to m&f if you have another good mace lined up
19:29 < OCTOTROG> staplegun (L21 GhCj) killed Donald. (Snake:3) [cbro+]
19:30 < zackoid> ??drain brand
19:30 < OCTOTROG> drain brand ~ draining brand[1/2]: 1/2 chance of doing an additional (dam/4 + 3) damage (on average) and applying a debuff similar to a HD reduction which is stackable, refreshable, and lasts 20-30 turns. Checks rN and only works against natural enemies. Disliked by good gods.
19:30 < Hildebrand> currently at 14.4 fighting, 14.0 axes, 10.2 m+f, 8.1 armour, 7.6 dodge, 8.0 shields

19:33 < zackoid> pop pop
19:33 < zackoid> if you are using shields might as well stick with m&f, you're more likely to find a good 1H mace than a good 1H axe
19:33 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L27 HaAs) reached level 3 of the Crypt. (Crypt:3) [cbro+]
19:34 < Almightybob> ??shillelagh
19:34 < OCTOTROG> devastator[1/5]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 8 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay). The shillelagh "Devastator". It's a +6 shillelagh that casts radius 1 shatter when you hit something with it, centered on the thing you hit. Won't hit you or break walls. Spellpower scales with melee damage dealt. Not as noisy as the actual shatter spell (15, same as fireball, instead of 30).
19:35 < Almightybob> ??shatter
19:35 < OCTOTROG> shatter[1/5]: Level 9 earth spell. Extremely powerful attack which does damage comparable to LCS to all non-flying non-amorphous monsters in LOS radius. Doesn't damage stuff on the other side of walls, but conveniently destroys nearby walls (and potions in 0.13 and earlier) anyway. Prior to 0.15, had a range of (3 + Earth/5).

19:44 < Almightybob> MR++ or just MR+?
19:46 < TheNoid> It does depend on race.
19:46 < zackoid> it depends on race, for Gr i think it's MR++ at 27
19:46 < Almightybob> Ok
19:46 < zackoid> but you should know that MR is not actually 5 levels like the display suggests, it's a continuous function
19:46 < zackoid> so 'natural' MR++ is not as good as say a ring with MR++

20:06 < sgun_> ??wrath
20:06 < OCTOTROG> penance[1/3]: With every god (not just yours), you have a penance number, which can be increased for long-term punishment. For every 1% of an XL you gain, there's a 10% chance of any particular god angry at you attempting divine retribution in the next 200 aut (on average); you then lose 1d3 points of penance for that god.
20:07 < Almightybob> ??reap

20:08 < OCTOTROG> contam[1/4]: Powerful enchantments have cumulative side effects on the body, represented by a magic contamination stat. When you get enough contam, you start glowing, and you can get mutations. But it decays - unless you are hasted or invisible. The mutations are 1/5 random, otherwise bad with a 50% chance of overriding mutation resistance.
20:08 < zackoid> ??contam[2
20:08 < OCTOTROG> contam[2/4]: The following effects cause magical contamination: haste, invisibility, extending haste, controlled blinking, mutagenic artifacts, Disjunction, Irradiate, some spell miscast effects (Charms, Hexes, Translocations and Transmutations), cancelling effects using stasis, (some) distortion unwields.
20:08 < zackoid> ??contam[3
20:08 < OCTOTROG> contam[3/4]: The contam timer triggers every 200-600 auts. If you have 5000+ (yellow) contam, there is a contam/12000 chance of getting a mutation (80% bad 20% random). If this happens with 10000+ (half way to light red) contam, there is also a 50% chance of releasing a magical explosion (random element, 3d(contam/2000) damage, radius rand_round(contam/15000) (min 1 max 9))
20:08 < zackoid> ??contam[4
20:08 < OCTOTROG> *contam[1/1]: An artefact property which contaminates you when you unequip the item in question.

22:24 < isthmus> nice
22:24 < zackoid> it's not that great with --en beacuse of too much overlap, but it's really good with any melee really

22:36 < zackoid> it's like 8 skill where they get back to full effect i think?  8 or 12
22:36 < isthmus> oh well, MuAs is definitely one of the worst combos overall, but for 'bad' mummy combos is not as bad as some
22:36 < zackoid> what counts as a bad mummy combo?
22:36 < zackoid> --wr? i don't think they can be --tm

23:02 < zackoid> and all it takes is two steps for the game to get REALLY EXCITING
23:02 < zackoid> poison nerf!
23:02 < isthmus> it's not like blowguns were overpowered or something
23:02 < isthmus> jeez
23:03 < zackoid> they were probably overused.  but now you just startscum for a dagger of venom
23:03 < zackoid> i mean i used them on literally every run that was not a minotaur or gargoyle

13:02 < zackoid> i was under the impression that allies did not interact with stealth at all, unless they attack?  i have no idea why i think that or how to verify it, though
13:03 < isthmus> that would have been my guess, but I don't have anything to back it up either - although orcs do shout, I don't know if that's just flavor text
13:03 < isthmus> you'd think all their yelling and commenting would be noisy
13:03 < zackoid> i'd hope not...but then i'd also hope that beogh didn't exist because he's terrible
13:04 < zackoid> so we're in bat country now.
13:04 < isthmus> Beogh is one of the best gods :P
13:04 < zackoid> best gods at being terrible i agree totally

13:31 <@ZureaL> a winnar is you!
13:32 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L6 MiBe) killed the ghost of mitcher2 the Skirmisher, an amateur HEFi of Okawaru. (D:4) [cbro+]
13:33 < roj> Well. Not yet.
13:33 < roj> I have a map now, so we'll see.
13:34 < roj> New topic: when is it worth it to switch to an off-skill-but-related weapon that seems like it has a cool brand?
13:34 < roj> Is a dagger of fire at skill 3 better than a sword +1 at skill 7?
13:35 < roj> (Imperically (empirically?) no, the sword chops down orcs faster)
13:36 < roj> (but maybe I'm missing something. Like high armor guys should be taken on with the dagger?) Or whatnot?
13:37 < OCTOTROG> staplegun (L24 GhCj) entered the Depths. (D:15) [cbro+]
13:38 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L10 MiBe) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:8) [cbro+]
13:39 <@ZureaL> roj, dagger damage is small, even though you're hitting faster and unless you're casting spells, I don't think I'd switch
13:39 <@ZureaL> unless fighing hydras...then your +1 sword is a disaster
13:39 < roj> I thought the same examining them.
13:39 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L10 MiBe) fell down a shaft to Lair:2. (Lair:1) [cbro+]
13:40 < roj> Yeah, I wanted to mess with the riposte stuff (it kills more than I do, honestly) and I fear the first hydra.
13:40 < roj> I try not to think about such things.
13:40 <@ZureaL> pick up a mace or something you can hit it with
13:40 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L8 MiBe) killed Menkaure. (D:7) [cbro+]
13:41 < roj> Well I smell with maces. Like, should I be cross training jsut for hydra?
13:41 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L11 MiBe) fell down a shaft to Lair:3. (Lair:2) [cbro+]
13:41 < roj> hydrii.
13:41 < roj> Or dumping all my poins inot fighting or something?
13:41 < roj> I guess there are some mid-fine points I'm still glossing over.
13:42 <@ZureaL> are you training any throwing/bows/slings or anything?
13:42 < roj> I though bows, but it takes like 15 turns to swap out.
13:42 < roj> I guess hte strategy would be to go upstairs, swap, come back to to fight a hydra.
13:42 < roj> ?
13:42 < roj> (not 15. More like 5, but still deadly)
13:43 < roj> Is that the usual strat? train a ranged thing in addition to a melee thing?
13:43 < OCTOTROG> staplegun (L24 GhCj) entered Wucad Mu's Monastery. (Depths:1) [cbro+]
13:43 <@ZureaL> I do
13:43 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L9 MiBe) killed Prince Ribbit. (D:8) [cbro+]
13:44 <@ZureaL> I usually do 100% focused on axes (as MiBe) until I find my first bow, then split training between bow, axe, fighting and armour at that point
13:44 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L10 MiBe) killed Pikel. (D:8) [cbro+]
13:45 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L11 MiBe) killed Gastronok. (Lair:1) [cbro+]
13:45 <@ZureaL> as an axe-wielding MiBe, I almost never train shield
13:45 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L18 MuNe) entered the Vaults. (D:14) [cbro+]
13:46 < roj> That was my next question. Not that I've found a big sword.
13:46 < roj> But it seems like if you're a super tough cow man AND you're wearing plate, the shield can maybe be the first thing you ignore.
13:46 < zackoid> i think having some sort of ranged attack is invaluable.  i also don't like axes.
13:46 < roj> You don't like axes? :)
13:46 < zackoid> good players think shields are bad, generally.  
13:46 < roj> Huh.
13:47 < zackoid> axes are the most expensive in terms of XP.
13:47 < TheNoid> I like shields.
13:47 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L10 MiBe) killed Erica. (D:8) [cbro+]
13:47 < roj> it DOES block a lot of shit that comes with attacks.
13:47 <@ZureaL> ha!
13:47 < roj> paralyzes, poisons and whatnot.
13:47 < zackoid> i agree with TheNoid, i think shields are underrated
13:47 <@ZureaL> shield of reflection is pretty awesome
13:47 < roj> I have a reflecting amulet in the game now.
13:47 < roj> It's killed two centaurs all by itself.
13:48 <@ZureaL> roj, I had that a few games back, died to a fucking cleric
13:48 <@ZureaL> iirc
13:48 < zackoid> to try to answer a previous question, whether you should use a short blade as a long blades user, you might for a very good one.  but a dagger of flaming is not a good weapon.
13:48 < roj> Clerics are the bane of most of the characters I play, yeah.
13:48 < roj> zackoid: Nod. I thi9nk my problem REALLY is 'how do I identify a good weapon'.
13:49 < sgun__> ??staff of wucad mu
13:49 < OCTOTROG> wucad mu[1/3]: Unrandart +9 staff, evoke for {channeling} MP but sometimes gives {divination miscast}s.
13:49 < sgun__> ??staff of wucad mu[2]
13:49 < OCTOTROG> channeling[1/1]: Converts food into mana. The staff succeeds (evo+11)/40, 50 hunger, 1d3 MP; Wucad Mu (evo+1)/25, 50 hunger, 1/5 div miscast, otherwise 2+d5+evo/3 MP;  Sif power 100-300 hunger, d(2+inv/4) mp. For reference, merely resting will recover 14+maxMP per 600 nutrition, at standard metabolic rates.
13:49 < roj> My D&D sensibilities and my nethack memory isn't helping.
13:49 < zackoid> it's a complicated answer that depends on the specifics for the most part
13:49 < roj> Yeeep.
13:50 < roj> I think I need to leave it for later.
13:50 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L11 MiBe) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:4) [cbro+]
13:50 <@ZureaL> in other words, go away kid, you're bothering me ;)
13:50 < zackoid> if you see an elec branded anything it's probably good, venom is very useful early on
13:50 <@ZureaL> Pikel with an electric whip is brutal
13:51 < roj> LIke the answer is probably 'stick with the thing you're training' since I won't recognize that a nearby mace of Awesome will be enough to get me through the, whatever, Tombs of Watery Pidgeons, because it has the perfect brand to counter damp flying rats.
13:51 < roj> So why pick it up.
13:51 <@ZureaL> well, if you're rocking a sword, you want SOMETHING to hit a hydra with
13:52 <@ZureaL> flaming scimitar would be lovely
13:52 < roj> Ah, flame brand but on-skill, okay.
13:52 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L11 MiBe) killed Grum. (D:11) [cbro+]
13:53 <@ZureaL> yup
13:53 < roj> Though! My most highest scoring game was something like my third, and I was just whacking hydra with a longsword and powering through with my hitpoints and accidental speed.
13:53 < roj> One of my higher ones.
13:53 < zackoid> or a good rapier, which doesn't cut heads.  but usually if i'm using a head-choppin' weapon i just plan on having javelins or wands or slings and some skill to use them
13:53 < zackoid> or just walkin' away.
13:53 < roj> I rmemember just being like "whelp! MIght as well!" and getting through a couple of (lone) hydra that way.
13:54 < zackoid> in heavy armour you can tank through them like that but it's not a good idea.
13:54 < roj> Yeah. That same char probably died to a hydra with a friend.
13:54 < zackoid> especially the ones that start with like 8 hgeads
13:54 < zackoid> there are no penalties for using ranged weapons point blank, fyi
13:55 < zackoid> i used a crappy falchion of flame in my last long blades game
13:55 < roj> Well, except the lack of sweet riposte.
13:55 < zackoid> fortunately they changed it so riposte doesn't chop heads
13:55 < roj> I think I have a bow I took of of some centaur, I'll train it up.
13:55 < zackoid> you'll have to give up the shield
13:55 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Bludgeoner (L12 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, mangled by a death yak on Lair:3, with 16893 points after 10698 turns and 0:40:33. [cbro+]
13:56 < roj> Right.
13:56 < roj> That's the main problem, is the inability to switch.
13:56 < zackoid> ^f javelins first
13:56 < roj> I guess I could jsut abandon shield and grab the first 2h sword I find.
13:56 < roj> HAven't seen any this game. 
13:56 < roj> Tommahawks, maybe.
13:56 < roj> But those chop.
13:56 < zackoid> do they?
13:56 < roj> I thought so.
13:57 < zackoid> ??tomahawk
13:57 < OCTOTROG> tomahawk[1/2]: (throwing; 6 dam / base delay 1.3 / 0.7 min delay). A small, axe-like item designed for throwing.
13:57 < zackoid> ??tomahawk[2
13:57 < OCTOTROG> tomahawk[2/2]: Bigger than a stone, smaller than a javelin. Mulch rate is 1/20. Base Damage is 6.
13:57 < zackoid> i doubt it but i have no idea really
13:57 < roj> Maybe I think that because of 'axe-like'?
13:57 < zackoid> who is your god?
13:57 < roj> ??hydra
13:57 < OCTOTROG> hydra[1/6]: Regenerating monster that attacks once for every head. Slicing or chopping (see [2]) attacks will cut off a head, causing two to grow in its place and healing the hydra for 7+d8 HP. Head count doesn't affect experience gained. Flaming edged weapons remove heads for good. A headless hydra dies instantly. Monsters chop hydra heads only about 1/4 of the time.
13:57 < roj> ??hydra[2
13:57 < OCTOTROG> hydra[2/6]: Weapons that chop off hydra heads are: all long blades, all axes, all two-handed polearms, cutlass, lajatang, and UC if you have Claws 3 or Blade Hands. Hydras are amphibious and swim as fast as merfolk. Polymorph is not a good idea (it is likely to turn into a dragon or something).
13:57 < roj> Okwaru. Okawaru. Oascar, the MeleeGuy
13:58 < roj> Ah, so no on tamahawks, then.
13:59 < roj> I follow a general plan for Fi of okwaru or trog, depending on who I see first.
14:00 < roj> I generally like okawaru a little better, I can't be F-d by badly managing berzerk downsides.

14:18 < odiv> at least on console it just puts up a timer and lets you in after that.
14:18 < odiv> like counts down while you wait so that if you don't want to disconnect the other game you quit.
14:19 < roj> 'Another game is already in progress using this save!'
14:20 < roj> I guess the webtiles is not so sophisticated.

15:11 < odiv> sif doesn't have channeling anymore right?
15:12 < odiv> I forget.
15:12 < odiv> ???sif muna
15:12 < OCTOTROG> God of magic and knowledge: 1*: {divine energy} invocation, 2*: miscast effect protection, 3*: {channel magic} invocation, 4*: {amnesia} invocation, 5*: Gifts {book acquirement}. Piety is gained by training magic skills and killing enemies. Miscast effect protection is piety/160, so guaranteed at 6*. / If for some reason you take Sif Muna with no spells. It takes until Spellcasting ~12
15:12 < OCTOTROG> (at average [-1] spellcasting apt) to get your first book, for a Monk (free ** piety) and until ~15 for other backgrounds. / 0.19 replaces channeling ability with {divine_energy} and at 3* adds {channel_magic}, an invocable MP regeneration. Piety now comes 2/3 from training magic skills and 1/3 from kills. / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tReTlabrCPI / Training skills with higher
15:12 < OCTOTROG> aptitudes does not get you more (or less) piety for your xp. Neither does training skills with lower levels.
15:12 < zackoid> sif has channeling but it's different
15:12 < zackoid> ??channel magic
15:12 < OCTOTROG> channel magic[1/1]: A 3* Sif Muna ability new to 0.19, gives a big boost to MP regeneration for a duration of 4 + random2avg(2 * INVOCATIONS / 3)
15:13 < odiv> I miss sublimation. :(
15:13 < zackoid> ??divine energy
15:13 < OCTOTROG> divine energy[1/2]: A 1* Sif Muna ability new to 0.19, allows the player to toggle a +Cast status on/off (doesn't take time!). When on, you'll be able to cast one more spell when too low on MP for a cost of -Cast for a few turns.
15:13 < zackoid> they got rid of sub blood?
15:13 < odiv> you can't use it on chunks anymroe I don't think.
15:13 < odiv> ??sublimation of blood
15:14 < OCTOTROG> sublimation of blood[1/1]: Converts HP into MP. Each MP point costs up to 4 (avg. 1 + 18/pow) HP. There is a 6/pow chance to stop after each MP point. Never drains more than 90% of current HP.
15:14 < zackoid> oh yeah it's HP.  that chunks thing was before my time.
15:14 < odiv> you used to be able to apport bodies too.
15:14 < zackoid> personally i hated old sif.  i think i would still dislike new sif but not as much.
15:14 < odiv> So I'd blast something at range, apport the body, make a skeleton, wield chunks, get more MP, rinse, repeat.
15:18 < zackoid> that sounds awful, heh
15:19 < odiv> Better than retreating!
15:19 < odiv> and mashing 5 until MP was full. :)

15:59 < roj> I bet it makes some monsters faster.
16:00 < zackoid> so part of how recite works is based on the god that the monster worships.  
16:00 < zackoid> because we all know what gods each monster worships, right?
16:01 < zackoid> and going farther through the codebase, 'impure' is based on attack flavours.  you've memorized your attack flavours, right?
16:01 < roj> ... blue raspberry in all cases.

20:12 <@slitherrr> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/rcfiles/crawl-0.19/slitherrr.rc to doublecheck it
20:12 < Hildebrand> seems like so many builds are that way... if you find a good item early it makes it easier to make a choice
20:18 < zackoid> Hildebrand: yes crawl is a game of adapting 
20:18 < zackoid> new players tend to only use axes for some reason i've never understood
20:18 < Hildebrand> the joy of cleaving
20:19 < Hildebrand> being able to go into a room and clear it in a few swings feels powerful
20:19 < Hildebrand> even if it is actually enabling bad behaviour
20:19 < zackoid> until you swing into the crowd and the crowd swings back.
20:19 < valrus> play uskayaw, then it's good behavior

23:27 < OCTOTROG> monster intelligence[1/12]: From worst to best: Brainless, Animal, Human. This has many effects on monster behaviour, most notably pursuing you longer, pathfinding better, being more wary of traps/clouds and moving in ways that inconviences you more.

23:27 < OCTOTROG> monster intelligence[2/12]: Stealth: As intelligence increases: *Forgets about you slower if you leave the level. *Remembers you longer if you leave LoS *Passes in-LoS stealth checks better. Also, Human are better at guessing the location of an invisible player, and Animal- relaxes their guard faster when wandering with you as their target.

10:43 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L5 MiBe) fell down a shaft to D:6. (D:3) [cbro+]
10:43 < Kimtruck> dangit
10:45 < Kimtruck> well I got two enchanted armours
10:46 < zackoid> if you fall down a 3-level shaft, it's a good time to use scrolls of mapping if you have any
10:46 < zackoid> find the stairs, go up
10:46 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L6 MiBe) killed Menkaure. (D:6) [cbro+]

10:48 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L7 MiBe) killed Duvessa. (D:5) [cbro+]
10:49 < Kimtruck> zackoid, yeah I beelined towards stairs
10:49 < Kimtruck> had no known scrolls of mapping
10:49 < OCTOTROG> Styro (L13 MiBe) killed the ghost of lukano the Bludgeoner, a journeyman MiBe of Trog. (Lair:4) [cbro+]
10:50 < roj> I always go down, back up when i encounter normal stairs, so I'll see them if I get to a lower level accidentally.
10:50 < roj> A habit from nethack.
10:50 < roj> Which, I bet will get me killed in DCSS. :)
10:51 < zackoid> risks are setting off portal timers, waking up nasty things, and it means you don't get a safe entry to that level later (first entrance on a level has guaranteed first move for you, others do not, taking the stairs takes more than 1 turn so you can get hit a lot going down)
10:51 < zackoid> dipping all 3 stairs when you are ready to hit the next level is a good paranoid idea, though.
10:51 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L8 MiBe) killed Sigmund. (D:4) [cbro+]
10:53 < roj> Yeah, protal timers are usually the only downside I see.
10:53 < roj> I have to race through a slightly harder level.
10:54 < zackoid> and you are less ready even if you do make it, and portals are generally more dangerous than the level they start on.  
10:55 < roj> Yeah.
10:55 < roj> Hmm.
10:55 < roj> Stupid nethack reflexes.
10:55 < zackoid> i don't think it's like a horrible move but i don't see any upside, and there are a few downsides.  
10:56 < roj> Well, if I fall I can get right back up.
10:56 < roj> I guess magic maps are a better answer.
10:57 < roj> Since I wil set off more portals than I will fall such that a quick up would actually save me.
10:57 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L8 MiBe) killed Pikel. (D:6) [cbro+]

14:39 < odiv> I asked and apparently there's no way tot track that.
14:39 < TheNoid> The potions thing?
14:39 < odiv> Which is a shame, because I want to complain a lot.

17:38 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L20 MiBe) entered the Crypt. (Vaults:3) [cbro+]
17:39 < odiv> that seems in line with the numbers they came up with for kim's weapon I think?
17:40 < lukano> oh I must have missed that :P
17:40 < odiv> zackoid: was it you who looked into that?
17:40 < odiv> I forget.
17:41 < lukano> though I guess the flipside is being able to use a shield with the whip, and I did just find a shield of resistance
17:41 < lukano> and I need to train sh up to make the amulet of reflect do its job
17:43 < zackoid> odiv: yeah but that was vs a slower weapon, not a faster one
17:45 < lukano> wait, dire flail is faster than demon whip?
17:45 < zackoid> no
17:45 < zackoid> i have a wizmode with a +14 dire flail, i'll test that vs a +7 demon whip quickly

17:52 < odiv> I forgot it was a slower weapon you had checked on.
17:52 < zackoid> yeah it was vs a great mace i think, because the conventional wisdom is that a great mace would be better
17:52 < zackoid> and the only reason i can think of that it's not is because of the min delay difference
17:52 < zackoid> even at 20 skill, the +14 DF was better than a +9 GM, which makes no sense 
17:53 < odiv> ah right.

21:12 < zackoid> i hope you mean crypt
21:13 < lukano> nah I'm putzing around tomb now, crypt is done
21:13 < zackoid> if you can't handle zot you can't handle tomb.

12:27 < johnstein> heh
12:27 < zackoid> tukima's is pretty great though i think it's hard to use hexes without specializing in them.  it does get a pretty big spellpower multiplier over most hexes though.
12:27 < johnstein> tukima' an ettin twice
12:28 < johnstein> tukima'd
12:28 < johnstein> wondering if I should wear bulkier armour
12:28 < johnstein> there's some enchanted scale and maybe chain
12:29 < zackoid> i doubt it, at least not yet.

12:32 < OCTOTROG> longbow[1/1]: Like a {shortbow}, but longer. 15 base damage, 1.7 base delay, 0.7 mindelay. Fires arrows. Small species (e.g. halflings) can't wield these. Try taking one from harmless monsters like centaur warriors, deep elf master archers, or Nessos!

18:52 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L21 HaSu) killed Frances. (D:13) [cbro+]
18:53 < Hildebrand> LRD?
18:53 < Hildebrand> ??LRD
18:53 < OCTOTROG> lrd[1/5]: Lee's Rapid Deconstruction: Turns walls into explosions. Useful for removing inconvenient stone or green crystal walls, though one needs fairly high power to pierce stone, and even higher to pierce metal (see {lrd[4]}). Causes lots of undodgeable damage to anything foolish enough to be near the wall (but AC is applied thrice).
18:54 < zackoid> odiv: impossible!
18:54 < odiv> ??crosstraining
18:54 < OCTOTROG> cross training[1/2]: 40% of the exp (not levels!) in any weapon skill is used to boost the cross-trained skill for free. Short <-> Long Blades, Maces <-> Axes, Axes <-> Polearms, Polearms <-> Staves, Maces <-> Staves, Slings <-> Throwing

19:04 < OCTOTROG> ice form[1/3]: +20% HP, rF-, rC+++, rPois. Makes you large, which will reduce EV (for human size and smaller races). Melds all armour, but gives 5-12 AC. 12+UC base damage with freezing brand. Players in ice form can float through water, but get no aquatic bonuses and can't reach submerged items. Found in Books of Changes and Ice, L4 ice/tmut.
19:04 < OCTOTROG> apoch the Chopper (L4 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by an orc priest on D:3, with 92 points after 1793 turns and 0:03:27. [cbro+]
19:18 < zackoid> ??spell power[2
19:18 < OCTOTROG> spell power[2/5]: ...and the significance of this? It's related to conjuration damage and self-enchantment duration, and controls the probability of a resistable spell succeeding in a less-simple fashion. And other appropriate things.
19:18 < zackoid> ??spell power[3
19:18 < OCTOTROG> spell power[3/5]: Note that the power of some spells is capped, most notably conjurations. This is indicated by having a short bar on the second I screen. (the # represent power, btw)
19:18 < zackoid> ??spell power[4
19:18 < OCTOTROG> spell power[4/5]: Got bars (#)? You have at least 0, 10, 15, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200.
19:19 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L17 DrTm) reached level 4 of the Shoals. (Shoals:4) [cbro+]
19:19 < zackoid> ??lightning rod
19:19 < OCTOTROG> lightning rod[1/2]: Fires a thunderbolt like a regular beam, then when evoked again fires lightning in the space between the first and second beams. Does not multizap.
19:19 < zackoid> ??lightning rod[2
19:19 < OCTOTROG> lightning rod[2/2]: Quite variable in cost and damage: does more damage and costs less when the resultant spread is smaller. It does good damage if you don't make much of a large spread. Accuracy on all but the first shot is absurdly high.
19:20 < zackoid> so how does it work if you want to use it in a line?

21:06 < apoch> only if going two handed
21:07 < apoch> if going two handed you want to get up to 26 for an executioner axe

21:08 < apoch> wait
21:08 < apoch> I've been playing too many MiFis.

22:15 < isthmus> hopefully someone here knows the spider vaults... johnstein?
22:15 < isthmus> I'd bet 5 potions of curing on the lower left
22:15 < johnstein> maybe?
22:15 < isthmus> but I'm playing a mummy so it's not worth much
22:15 < johnstein> &&watchlink Hildebrand
22:15 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.berotato.org:8080/#watch-Hildebrand
22:16 < johnstein> yea. the vault is almost certainly at the bottom
22:16 < johnstein> but left looks super suspicious
22:16 < johnstein> hah
22:16 < odiv> the +2 scimitar "Kiuzem" {elec, rPois rC+ Stlth+}
22:16 < odiv> hmmm

22:17 < odiv> ??cross training
22:17 < OCTOTROG> cross training[1/2]: 40% of the exp (not levels!) in any weapon skill is used to boost the cross-trained skill for free. Short <-> Long Blades, Maces <-> Axes, Axes <-> Polearms, Polearms <-> Staves, Maces <-> Staves, Slings <-> Throwing
22:17 < isthmus> well hildebrand, you seem to be wading through things like crazy, so maybe just kill everything and see what happens :)
22:17 < Hildebrand> X - the +13 flail "Lyawkuyto" (weapon) {drain, Fragile rF++ Dex+3}
22:17 < Hildebrand> that helps
22:17 < isthmus> yeah, that looks pretty nice

22:20 <@shmup> !apt hofi

22:20 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L6 MiBe) entered an ossuary. (D:5) [cbro+]
22:20 < OCTOTROG> shmup (L1 HOFi) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
22:21 < isthmus> if you find a godlike mace on dungeon:2 or something, you could switch
22:21 < johnstein> yep the entire remaining part is the tune vault
22:21 < Hildebrand> _T - the +9 demon whip "Eviscerator" {elec, rF+ rC++ Dex-2}
22:21 < isthmus> jeez
22:21 < Hildebrand> but if i take off my current whip, its destroyed :(
22:22 < Hildebrand> in all seriousness, its better isnt it?
22:22 < isthmus> and you have to switch to the cruddy +9 demon whip of elec with rF+ and rC++... dang
22:23 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L7 MiBe) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:5) [cbro+]
22:23 < Hildebrand> the demon whip is better isnt it?
22:24 < isthmus> seems like it would be, but I'm not a number cruncher. it could be a close call.
22:24 < isthmus> the base type is way better
22:24 < isthmus> I have no idea how the +slaying attribute shakes out these days though, it's gotten better and worse over time
22:25 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L8 MiBe) killed the ghost of UberJew the Grappler, a novice TrMo of Zin. (D:6) [cbro+]
22:25 < isthmus> at any rate, you can't ever be sad to wield that demon whip :)
22:25 < Hildebrand> pmuch
22:26 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L12 DgEE) killed Nessos. (D:13) [cbro+]
22:27 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L8 MiBe) killed the ghost of Shadowablaze the Spear-Bearer, a novice MfGl of Okawaru. (D:7) [cbro+]
22:28 < Hildebrand> gonna switch weapons now, sigh at loosing one but oh well
22:29 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L16 MiBe) found a gossamer rune of Zot. (Spider:4) [cbro+]
22:29 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L9 MiBe) killed Pikel. (D:7) [cbro+]
22:30 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L17 MiBe) killed Frances. (Shoals:1) [cbro+]
22:30 < Hildebrand> i hate shoals w/o flight
22:31 < isthmus> I can't spectate your game anymore, you're too strong
22:31 < isthmus> I've got one of those barely-surviving games going
22:32 < isthmus> if you have any future questions, my answer is: just kill everything :)
22:32 < isthmus> j/k of course
22:34 < Hildebrand> :P
22:34 < Hildebrand> is there a point where you want to stop putting points into throwing?
22:34 < Hildebrand> ??evocations
22:34 < OCTOTROG> evocations[1/1]: This skill affects wands, abilities related to decks, and abilities gained from items. Evocation skill adds to wand power, though spell power caps are still respected. Gives you more MP.
22:35 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L13 DgEE) killed Urug. (Lair:3) [cbro+]
22:36 < odiv> man
22:36 < odiv> demon trident
22:36 < odiv> also some ok long blades
22:36 < odiv> should I go necro for animate dead?
22:36 < odiv> hmmm
22:36 < Hildebrand> ??throwing
22:36 < OCTOTROG> throwing[1/2]: Throw stones, tomahawks, javelins, large rocks at target to kill them. See {blowgun} for the skill's effect on needles. See {ammunition} for the base damage of various throwing items.
22:36 < isthmus> hildebrand, if I'm using a lot of javelins I will train it to like 12 or 15 by the endgame
22:37 < Hildebrand> was making use of the tomahawks to kill the orb spiders
22:37 < isthmus> they might have rebalanced it recently, I know they changed the way blowguns work
22:37 < isthmus> you got shoals so you should be well stocked on javelins
22:38 < isthmus> javelins of penetration are good for taking out crowds in depths and zot
22:38 < Hildebrand> javelins better than tomahawks?
22:38 < isthmus> yep
22:38 < isthmus> zackoid can step in to correct any of my inaccuracies based on old versions
22:39 < isthmus> lately he's been like "heh, sorry, they took that out 5 versions ago" to me
22:40 < isthmus> on the other hand, I only need 3 more pokemon to complete the north american pokedex, so it's a tradeoff
22:42 < Hildebrand> still playing pokemon go?
22:43 < Hildebrand> ??quiver
22:43 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled quiver in my learndb.
22:47 < isthmus> I started 2 months late
22:47 < isthmus> so I'm just getting caught up / burned out
22:47 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L17 MiBe) reached level 4 of the Shoals. (Shoals:4) [cbro+]
22:48 < odiv> Hm, I do have a book of calling and staff of summoning

22:48 < OCTOTROG> odiv the L13 DgEE^ in Lair:3 (cbro console), T:21067, defenses: 11/19/0, stats: 15/27/16
22:48 < isthmus> with a demigod, animate dead might be a stretch
22:49 < isthmus> stick with your specialty
22:49 < isthmus> animate skeleton is pretty damned good, and still useful in Zot
22:49 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L17 MiBe) found a barnacled rune of Zot. (Shoals:4) [cbro+]
22:49 < odiv> what's my specialty?
22:49 < isthmus> you're an earth elementalist right?
22:49 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L13 DgEE) entered the Orcish Mines. (D:9) [cbro+]
22:49 < isthmus> stay in earth magic, imho
22:50 < isthmus> #dump odiv
22:50 < isthmus> ^dump odiv
22:50 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/odiv/odiv.txt [cbro]
22:51 < isthmus> are you short on earth books?
22:51 < Hildebrand> isthmus, if i already have the rune, shall i finish the level, or just get out of here?
22:51 < odiv> Yeah, I only have the starting book
22:51 < isthmus> if you already got earth magic to 10, that's significant, demigods can't branch into too many paths
22:51 < isthmus> what about conjurations? do you have orb of destruction?
22:52 < odiv> no
22:52 < isthmus> you can stick with LRD for most of the game and keep hoping for the earth books
22:52 < odiv> I only have unlife, geomancy, cantrips, callings
22:52 < odiv> yeah, just checked again
22:52 < odiv> ??book of unlife
22:52 < OCTOTROG> book of unlife[1/1]: Recall, Animate Dead, Control Undead, Cigotuvi's Embrace, Death Channel, Simulacrum.
22:52 < odiv> no draining bolt
22:52 < isthmus> dang... well, train up the hybrid skills, fighting, dodging, weapon skills
22:52 < odiv> hm
22:53 < odiv> yeah, so far doing that minus weapon
22:53 < odiv> also evoc
22:53 < odiv> hopefully for staff
22:53 < isthmus> 12 evoc is good enough until the endgame
22:53 < odiv> but right now for lightning rod and rod of shadows
22:53 < odiv> and misc others
22:53 < isthmus> hmm, cool
22:53 < isthmus> rod of shadows is pretty great
22:53 < odiv> at higher levels yeah :P
22:54 < odiv> maybe I'll dump a bunch of points into shields until I get a book/plan
22:54 < isthmus> hildebrand, shoals 4 has good loot, but you can die.. come clean it up later maybe
22:54 < Hildebrand> depths next then?
22:54 < isthmus> can't believe you have no weapon skills
22:54 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L13 DgEE) killed Dowan. (D:5) [cbro+]
22:54 < isthmus> hildebrand, you can peek into depths but I would go for vaults next
22:54 < Hildebrand> ??hyperelliptic
22:54 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L13 DgEE) killed Duvessa. (D:5) [cbro+]
22:55 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot
22:55 < odiv> same turn!
22:55 < odiv> yay lrd
22:55 < isthmus> depths would be nice if there's a convenient shop or something, but back out when you find a major threat
22:55 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L17 MiBe) entered the Vaults. (D:13) [cbro+]
22:55 < Hildebrand> just gotta remember no doing vaults 5
22:55 < isthmus> if vaults becomes too mcuh you can try elf
22:55 < Hildebrand> well, is it still 5?
22:55 < isthmus> yep
22:56 < isthmus> when you are on vaults:4, and you find a downward staircase, put a warning on it with the ! key, saying "wait till later"
22:56 < odiv> also have an ice ring, so I'd take an ice book at this point maybe
22:57 < isthmus> odiv, if you branch out I would hope for some conjuration books. conj skill would benefit Iron Shot and LRD
22:58 < odiv> I could also learn petrify and branch out into transfig, but honestly I'd just be hoping for statue so eh
22:58 < odiv> LRD is straight earth
22:58 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L13 DgEE) killed Psyche. (D:11) [cbro+]
22:59 < isthmus> did they change it?
22:59 < isthmus> ???lrd
22:59 < OCTOTROG> Lee's Rapid Deconstruction: Turns walls into explosions. Useful for removing inconvenient stone or green crystal walls, though one needs fairly high power to pierce stone, and even higher to pierce metal (see {lrd[4]}). Causes lots of undodgeable damage to anything foolish enough to be near the wall (but AC is applied thrice). / LRD also works on enemies with varying effectiveness.
22:59 < OCTOTROG> Regular enemies are untargetable, but statues, most golems, and anything petrified or made of metal, rock, or ice will be damaged and spray fragments of varying range/damage. Pre-0.14, skeletal enemies had a good, power-based chance to instantly die (including bone dragons!) / Works on doors (open or closed), making it one of the more effective ways to open one from afar.
22:59 < OCTOTROG> Furthermore, it works (without destroying) on stone arches, and can majorly piss Beogh off when used on an orcish idol. It does nothing when the floor is targeted. / You need the following amount of spell power to have a shot at destroying a wall: rock: 35, stone: 50, metal: 75 (5, 6 and 7 bars of power respectively). Green crystal has a 50% chance to be shattered regardless of
22:59 < OCTOTROG> spell power. At low spellpower rock and crystal walls do more damage. / Useful: can still explode doors when a vault warden has sealed them.
22:59 < OCTOTROG> Zombiesheep (L19 FoFi) reached level 4 of the Snake Pit. (Snake:4) [cjr]
22:59 < Hildebrand> ??fire dragon scales
22:59 < isthmus> oh, sorry
22:59 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled fire_dragon_scales in my learndb.

22:59 < isthmus> er,
22:59 < Hildebrand> so wtf are fire dragon scales?

22:59 < isthmus> hildebrand, it's fire dragon armour
22:59 < isthmus> ???fda
22:59 < OCTOTROG> 8AC, 11ER, rF++ rC-. Can be created by enchanting a fire dragon hide.
23:00 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L13 DgEE) killed Josephine. (D:11) [cbro+]
23:00 < Hildebrand> oh, gotta use a scroll on it still?
23:00 < isthmus> they just changed the name, and made it so dragons generate the armour instead of the hide
23:00 < isthmus> no scroll necessary anymore
23:02 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L10 MiBe) killed Grum. (D:9) [cbro+]
23:02 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L11 MiBe) killed Joseph. (D:9) [cbro+]

23:03 < Hildebrand> oh, isthmus do i need to train m+f past 16 at this point?
23:03 < Hildebrand> i had increased it due to having an eveningstar, but yeah
23:03 < isthmus> conventional wisdom is to train it to your best weapon's max speed
23:04 < isthmus> I usually train it to 27 at the very end, for super good damage, but maybe the number crunchers would say that's bad
23:04 < isthmus> with your demon whip, you don't need to train it more

23:08 < johnstein> does orange cpa only generate max one time per game?
23:08 < johnstein> ??orange cpa
23:08 < OCTOTROG> orange crystal plate armour[1/2]: An unrandart +8 crystal plate armour {Archmagi, Int+3 Clar SustAb}. You may have been looking for Octopode Paladin, though.
23:09 < isthmus> hildebrand, do you have any large shields? I'd focus on armour and shields and fighting
23:09 < johnstein> oh it's unique
23:09 < isthmus> if you have a large shield I'd focus on shields
23:09 < Hildebrand> no large shields
23:09 < Hildebrand> just a shield of protection
23:09 < isthmus> not bad
23:09 < isthmus> any better heavy armour around?
23:09 < Hildebrand> nope
23:10 < isthmus> you can get gold dragon armour on vaults 5 or zot

23:25 < Hildebrand> bleh
23:25 < zackoid> Hildebrand: i would just train throwing all game
23:26 < zackoid> err 16, not 20.  but it gets more powerful with more skill anyway

23:58 < zackoid> you can but you don't want to
23:58 < zackoid> as a mibe you basically don't care about stats
23:59 < Hildebrand> do we try our luck with the morningstar?

00:41 < johnstein> ??shields
00:41 < OCTOTROG> shield[1/5]: Wearing a shield gives you a chance to block all damage from some attacks, including arrows, melee, and some spells. Shields prevent off-hand attacks, and until you have enough skill they also slow your melee attacks and make it harder to cast spells.
00:42 < johnstein> so if you have a buckler of reflection with 10.5 skill and find a shield of reflection, is it better to wear the shield?

00:42 < OCTOTROG> Wearing a shield gives you a chance to block all damage from some attacks, including arrows, melee, and some spells. Shields prevent off-hand attacks, and until you have enough skill they also slow your melee attacks and make it harder to cast spells. / You need 4/15/25 skill to eliminate evasion, melee speed, and casting penalties for bucklers/shields/large shields for normal
00:42 < OCTOTROG> races, 5.6/21/- for kobolds and halflings, 7.2/-/- for spriggans, 2.4/9/15 for nagas, centaurs, and formicids, -/9/15 for trolls and ogres. / Shields can be enchanted to +3 (higher in 0.15). Each enchantment increases SH by 1. Bucklers (5 SH, -1 EV); Shields (8 SH, -3 EV); Large Shield (13 SH, -5 EV). Every level of shield skill increases SH by 1/20 of the base shield value. You
00:42 < OCTOTROG> get an effective SH bonus based on your str and dex (large and regular) or dex (for bucklers). / You will block a missile if a random number up to 130% of the missile to-hit is less than a random number (on 2 dice) up to 2/3 of your SH; a melee instead uses a random number up to 15 + to-hit / 2. Both to-pass-shield values are inflated by 5 * (previous blocks this turn)^2. /

13:05 < johnstein> moment of weakness? I think spell power. I only recently switched
13:06 < johnstein> maybe I should stop using infusion? Ajmer my regen seemed underpowered
13:07 < johnstein> was considering gell's
13:07 < johnstein> but it doesn't feel like a solid thing
13:08 < zackoid> i've never found a use for it
13:08 < johnstein> ok
13:08 < zackoid> i think you need to get that really, really good glaive to mindelay
13:08 < zackoid> your defenses are good, but you've been undertraining that all game
13:09 < johnstein> oops
13:09 < johnstein> elec came from

13:09 < johnstein> ??glaive
13:09 < OCTOTROG> glaive[1/2]: (polearms; -3 acc / 15 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). A pole with a large, heavy blade on one end. Glaives chop hydra heads.

13:10 < zackoid> it's really good
13:11 < zackoid> L - the +6 scale mail of Pantheism {rN+ Int+4 Dex+5}.
13:11 < zackoid> if only i could wear that
13:11 < johnstein> oh. it seems to do the trick. but I can't take many hits. maybe I should do * polearms and +dodge?
13:12 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L7 MfIE) killed Sigmund. (D:5) [cbro+]
13:12 < zackoid> sure though i would have thought 20EV was a lot for that point
13:13 < zackoid> you might have overtrained armour for that point in the game?
13:13 < zackoid> hard to tell.
13:13 < johnstein> probably
13:13 < johnstein> I think I was considering some heavier armour at one point
13:13 < zackoid> i need a damn god.
13:13 < johnstein> despite winning a few hybrids, I'm pretty bad at ten
13:13 < johnstein> them
13:14 < zackoid> i usually stick to ring until after say vaults, then consider moving up to FDA or so depending on spells and str and the quality of the ring
13:14 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L7 MfIE) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:6) [cbro+]
13:14 < johnstein> yea. I have a few in game to choose from
13:14 < johnstein> ring
13:15 < zackoid> dangit.
13:15 < zackoid> that is a really good ring mail, obvs
13:16 < zackoid> though without haste i'm not sure there's any reason not to move up to higher ER now
13:16 < zackoid> are there any spells > level 4 you are even interested in?

13:18 < OCTOTROG> discord[1/4]: Level 8 Hexes spell. Has a chance to cause enemies in LOS to go into {frenzy}. Checks MR. Does not work on monsters with plant int.
13:18 < johnstein> ??hexes
13:18 < OCTOTROG> hexes[1/4]: Contains all the good hexes, after Enchantments was split into Charms and Hexes. Enchanters start with a {Book of Maledictions}. To see Hexes spells, see hexes[2]. To see books which contain Hexes spells, see hexes[3].

13:19 < zackoid> probably not
13:19 < johnstein> yea
13:19 < zackoid> http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Spell_Levels
13:19 < zackoid> i had 22 hexes on a VpEn to use discord, but that's an all-in hexes
13:20 < johnstein> feel like I need to ensure spectral weapon is online and cause fear is strong enough to work in depths and zot
13:20 < zackoid> i suggested it for spider because nothing in spider has any MR
13:21 < zackoid> well that's not true, but the spider packs don't
13:21 < zackoid> but later in the game it has a lot less utility
13:21 < zackoid> do you have blink available?

15:01 < valrus> Hildebrand: clear the outer ring before going to the center
15:01 < valrus> I recommend against using autoexplore unless you set exclusions first
15:02 < valrus> my recent game I autoexplored right up to within LOS of the royal jelly
15:02 < odiv> Yeah, don't autoexplore in slime period imo
15:02 < odiv> your aim is never to clear any of the floors

15:03 < Hildebrand> ??the royal jelly
15:03 < OCTOTROG> the royal jelly[1/7]: Boss of the Slime Pits. Damage causes the creation of high-level Js such as acid blobs and azure jellies, which will never be on the other side of a wall and give no experience. When killed, the level allows teleport control, and the loot chamber walls become transparent and diggable.
15:03 < zackoid> man how am i only xl 11
15:04 < valrus> also, TRJ didn't used to heal but it does now
15:04 < Hildebrand> uh, i was going around the outside and it aggroed?
15:04 < valrus> so I recommend buffing before you take it on so you don't have to go in more than once
15:04 < valrus> that's... not something I've ever experienced! did you make a ruckus?
15:05 < zackoid> it happens a lot if you have 0 stealth

01:38 < staplegun> ??hydra
01:38 < OCTOTROG> hydra[1/6]: Regenerating monster that attacks once for every head.

01:53 < isthmus> ???stabbing
01:53 < OCTOTROG> A stab with a short blade does increased damage: (dam+bonus)*mult, where bonus depends on your dex as well as your stealth and weapon skills and is capped at 30, and mult depends on your stealth/weapon skills and the type of stab (sleep/paralysis is best). Non-short blades don't get a bonus and have lower mult. Daggers get bonus doubled (but still capped at 30). / If you are using
01:53 < OCTOTROG> short blades, stab damage bonus is (DEX * (((stealth skill + sblade skill) / 2) + 1)) / 5, halved if you are not wielding a dagger, and then put through a stepdown function: halve the part over 10, then halve the part over 20, then cap at 30. / For short/long blades and one-handed polearms, stab damage gets a bonus multiplier of (10 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / ({stab
01:53 < OCTOTROG> bonus} + 2 (if using a long blade or one-handed polearm))) / 10 / Finally, stab damage gets an additional bonus multiplier of (12 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / {stab bonus}) / 12 for all weapons. / (lower is better): sleeping/paralysed = 1, netted/webbed/petrifying/petrified = 2, invisible/confused/fleeing/ally = 4, distracted = 6
01:55 < isthmus> wow, that formula is a bit complicated
01:56 < isthmus> trying to figure out if I can graduate from daggers
01:56 < isthmus> I think my bonus is still only at 27
01:56 < isthmus> so I'll work on stealth some more
01:56 < isthmus> or just accept a 27 bonus, probably

09:11 < zackoid> why are there .17-a games
09:11 < advil> we peaked at 0.16
09:12 < advil> there was some weird thing with the versioning
09:12 < zackoid> does t just mean during the tourney period?
09:12 < advil> no, 0.17 they had an issue where non-release versions were used at the beginning of the tournament
09:12 < advil> and they counted the games iirc
09:12 < zackoid> .16 was noticably easier than .18+, but i suspect the biggest issue is the relative contributions of new and old players.
09:12 < zackoid> ah.
09:12 < advil> 0.16 was meleebug no?
09:13 < zackoid> yeah
09:13 < zackoid> but even the .16.1 was easier i think

09:14 < advil> heh
09:14 < zackoid> is .17 the one where you had horrible luck with getting 1-shot?
09:14 < advil> yeah
09:14 < advil> well "luck"
09:14 < advil> I wasn't playing that well either
09:14 < zackoid> i'm willing to mark down the beogh statue one as luck
09:14 < advil> ok fair
09:14 < advil> the abyss one was the one that really stung
09:15 < advil> and I think that should have been avoidable

12:20 < johnstein> you know. maybe an amulet of faith would be useful for me
12:20 < johnstein> I'm fine if I can hero it up
12:20 < johnstein> and especially fine if I can swift
12:21 < johnstein> I hate the amulet because of accidentally wield IDing it. but it might be a way to keep me alive till I find other good stuff
12:21 < johnstein> ??faith
12:22 < OCTOTROG> amulet of faith[1/2]: Piety increases one quarter faster. Yes, this means you get more gifts. Ru offers sacrifices more quickly; Xom has more dynamic piety and acts more often; no effect with Gozag. Removing the amulet reduces your piety by 1/3.
12:22 < zackoid> what are you wearing now?
12:23 < johnstein> reflect or mp regen
12:23 < johnstein> that's basically all I've seen
12:23 < johnstein> plus faith
12:23 < johnstein> and a randart with inacc
12:24 < johnstein> it's been a pretty sad game wrt jewelry
12:24 < zackoid> faith is probably better than any of those yeah
12:24 < zackoid> reflect isn't very good unless you're using a shield
12:24 < johnstein> and should help me get more arrows

12:29 < zackoid> ??rod of shadows

12:29 < OCTOTROG> rod of shadows[2/2]: Since it used the OOD timer prior to 0.16, waiting around for a huge amount of time on your current floor would get you similar or better results for less investment.
12:32 < johnstein> yea. I switched over to polearms
12:32 < johnstein> almost to xl2

16:21 < OCTOTROG> shmup (L4 HOFi) killed Robin. (D:3) [cbro+]
16:28 < johnstein> ??lrd
16:28 < OCTOTROG> lrd[1/5]: Lee's Rapid Deconstruction: Turns walls into explosions. Useful for removing inconvenient stone or green crystal walls, though one needs fairly high power to pierce stone, and even higher to pierce metal (see {lrd[4]}). Causes lots of undodgeable damage to anything foolish enough to be near the wall (but AC is applied thrice).
16:28 < johnstein> ??reflection
16:28 < OCTOTROG> reflection[1/2]: A shield of reflection will reflect blocked missiles back the way they came from. Mostly useless.  Note that if you worship a deity that frowns upon certain attacks, reflecting those attacks will not cause penance.
16:28 < johnstein> ??reflection[2
16:28 < OCTOTROG> reflection[2/2]: The spriggan defender reflects the flood of elemental water off its shiny buckler! The flood of elemental water misses you. Splash! You fall into the shallow water.
16:30 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L27 MfMo) found a silver rune of Zot. (Vaults:5) [cbro+]
16:30 < johnstein> so if you don't have a shield reflection amulet still works right?
16:30 < omnomnOMINOUS> correct
16:33 < odiv> yes
16:33 < odiv> just not well
16:33 < odiv> I have an SH of 4.
16:33 < odiv> so, not blocking much. :(
16:34 < johnstein> so a shield helps it reflect more?
16:34 < odiv> yep
16:34 < johnstein> ie to reflect it has to pass the shield block first?
16:35 < johnstein> or are they separate rolls
16:35 < johnstein> I always thought it was separate but I have nothing to back up that assumption
16:36 < odiv> ??amulet of reflection
16:36 < OCTOTROG> amulet of reflection[1/1]: The amulet of reflection gives you a variable amount of SH and the reflection status, allowing you to reflect projectiles shot at you as if you had a shield of reflection, whether or not you do. Enchantment is randomly from +2 to +6, so pick up additional amulets if yours isn't +6.
16:36 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L27 MfMo) entered the Desolation of Salt. (Elf:2) [cbro+]
16:36 < odiv> reflection is just a status
16:38 < johnstein> so it is separate
16:39 < johnstein> well. dunno
16:40 < odiv> Well the status is separate than the SH
16:40 < odiv> the amulet gives you two things, the status and the SH.
16:40 < odiv> status gives you a % chance to reflect if something is blocked.
16:40 < odiv> SH gives you a chance to block something.
16:41 < odiv> Pretty sure that's how it works.
16:41 < zackoid> yes, they're not seperate
16:41 < zackoid> a projectile has to be blocked for it to reflect
16:41 < zackoid> the chances of it being blocked depend on SH
16:42 < zackoid> also note that most spells are unblockable
16:46 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L27 MfMo) reached level 3 of the Elven Halls. (Elf:3) [cbro+]
16:47 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L27 MfMo) entered the Abyss! (Depths:1) [cbro+]
17:05 < omnomnOMINOUS> how do you find the abyssal rune? do you just autoexplore on abyss:3 or 4 ish?
17:05 < omnomnOMINOUS> or is it better to go deeper into the abyss?
17:08 < zackoid> stay on 3, wander around.  i don't auto explore
17:10 < zackoid> keep an eye out for structures or groups of enemies that look non-random
17:19 < advil> oh right, snakebite
17:19 < advil> too bad I have swamp and snake
17:21 < OCTOTROG> advil (L15 HOGl) entered the Snake Pit. (Lair:2) [cbro+]

17:24 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L27 MfMo) found an abyssal rune of Zot. (Abyss:4) [cbro+]

17:26 < odiv> this lab is weird
17:26 < odiv> I hope I don't die here.
17:26 < odiv> I always go diagonally in abyss
17:29 < advil> ??vitalization
17:29 < OCTOTROG> vitalisation[1/1]: Protects you from sickness, poison, confusion, petrification, rot and stat drain while active, and boosts your stats (up to +9 each, depending on Invoc skill). 
17:31 < advil> kirke and francis on swamp 2
17:31 < OCTOTROG> advil (L16 HOGl) entered the Orcish Mines. (D:10) [cbro+]

17:37 < advil> that's a sad story
17:37 < zackoid> also fcloud is at 90% fail despite that i thought i had overtrained spells
17:37 < advil> my sad story is that there's all this tasty orcflesh in here that I can't eat
17:38 < zackoid> this char is a mess
17:42 < odiv> my sad story is that I don't know what this lab is all about

17:44 < omnomnOMINOUS> second
17:44 < odiv> I miss when it was a lot more random.
17:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> the other time i got banished directly into the abyss:4 rune vault so i just had to kill like a juggernaut and two cherubim
17:45 < odiv> ha
17:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> and that was tense because i hadn't seen a juggernaut before
17:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> but at least i didn't have to navigate
17:45 < odiv> I'm pretty sure I got banished almost immediately next ot the rune, then picked it up, then found an exit
17:45 < odiv> back when there weren't floors.

21:54 < zackoid> makes sense
21:55 < johnstein> but it usually ends up having a better overall level layout
21:55 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L9 MiBe) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:8) [cbro+]
21:55 < johnstein> the other vaults are so big that they can't be placed well with the other layouts for crypt
21:55 < johnstein> so they are only using the boring ones
21:55 < johnstein> I was working on a fix and a new layout that would make more interesting ends
21:56 < johnstein> since I think it's pretty lame that there are 4 encompass vaults that are basically the same exact levels over and over, and 2 of the 4 floating end vaults are so big they practically ARE the level.
21:56  * johnstein has a lot of marginally useful knowledge of the crypt ends
21:57 < johnstein> interesting that there's a 50/50 for liches vs aliches
21:57 < johnstein> kinda figure you'd tweak it so you don't always get 4 liches or 4 aliches
21:59 < johnstein> zackoid, I lied earlier. there's also an amulet of rage in the game.

08:59 < advil> oh right, demon whips are evil
08:59 < zackoid> did you bless something already?
08:59 < zackoid> oh wait you're zin nm
08:59 < advil> yeah
08:59 < zackoid> though you could do the dance
08:59 < advil> I suppose, I guess it depends if I end up doing more runes
09:00 < advil> I've trained a lot of axes in any case
09:00 < advil> but I'd be close to mindelay on a demon whip
09:00 < advil> since I trained M&F for snakebite
09:00 < zackoid> don't they cross train also?
09:01 < advil> yeah
09:02 < advil> I'm at axes 19.8/20.1, M&F 5.8/12.7
09:04 < zackoid> that is a very high vitalization to recite ratio, was that from rune branches without rpois?
09:05 < advil> yeah, pretty much
09:05 < advil> I probably don't use recite enough but it is useless in swamp
09:05 < zackoid> have you ever looked up the recite codepath?  i was gonna tell you about it last week when i was playing zin
09:05 < advil> I think my rate of vit is appropriate though
09:06 < advil> no, I'm guessing it's a bit like the miscast codepath though
09:06 < zackoid> i never got a good handle on what exactly is vulnerable to it, so i decided to look it up.  turns out there's a very good reason why none of the descriptions of it make any sense
09:06 < advil> if you x a monster it gives you some hints
09:06 < advil> but isn't it basically int x hd x hated by zin?
09:06 < zackoid> i still haven't figured out if there is a class that it is totally useless on, does it do anything to bugs or animals?
09:07 < zackoid> sorta but there's all kinds of hardcoded special cases
09:07 < advil> no, if you recite with only non-intelligent things around it doesn't even let you
09:07 < advil> "no appreciative audience"
09:07 < zackoid> and also HD and intelligence and hated by zin are not things that are well communicated to the player heh
09:08 < advil> when looking at a monster it says "It is weak enough to be recited to."
09:08 < advil> which I think is HD
09:08 < advil> though it will say that for non-intelligent things
09:10 < advil> what are the special cases?
09:10 < advil> I was also going by the wiki description
09:11 < zackoid> i'm looking it up now
09:11 < zackoid> demigods are one, which i think means only frederick
09:12 < zackoid> i think the biggest thing is monsters which have gods of their own, which outside of orcs i have no handle on
09:12 < advil> heh
09:12 < advil> zin's been around forever, so it seems likely there's all sorts of traces of stuff from 15 years ago
09:12 < advil> I think there were more demigod monsters at one point
09:12 < advil> deep elves have some religion, right?
09:13 < zackoid> no idea, and i have a ridiculously embarassing number of hours in this game
09:13 < zackoid> most of it is in godabil.cc
09:14 < zackoid> ah here are the weird cases:
09:14 < advil> they always show up with vehumet altars and whatnot
09:14 < zackoid> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/24d37aaa1f410fe53df520af77736b379ba67c61/crawl-ref/source/monster.cc#L3627
09:14 < zackoid> hope you know your attack flavours!
09:14 < advil> recite did work well on louise
09:15 < advil> something tells me zin wouldn't like dishonored
09:15 < zackoid> if you asked me which uniques are insane, i would have got yiuf and maybe psyche eventually
09:15 < zackoid> wtf is wrong with gastronok?
09:15 < zackoid> has_unclean_spell().  i have a great intuition of who that includes.
09:16 <@shmup> lol
09:16 < zackoid> holiness() & MH_UNDEAD && !is_insubstantial() <- why
09:17 < zackoid> it's basically Spoilers: The God
09:17 < advil> well, I don't think you can go wrong by just reciting a lot
09:20 < zackoid> no i just think it's unnecessarily confusing
09:20 < zackoid> i thought the wiki page was bad but the learndb entry is worse
09:21 < zackoid> i think despite two wins with zin (both late switches) i've used imprison or sanctuary
09:21 < zackoid> never used
09:21 < advil> sanctuary is incredibly powerful
09:22 < advil> maybe the single best panic button

10:41 < OCTOTROG> Mutation: "Space occasionally distorts in your vicinity." Occasionally attempts to teleport you to a random spot in a (15, 30, no limit) square radius. The teleport is cancelled if there are no monsters near the target spot. {ring of teleportation} has no range limit.
10:41 < odiv> it used to be evocable
10:41 < odiv> it also used to put you in a random spot
10:41 < odiv> now it only does it if there are monsters nearby.
10:42 < odiv> slowly took out every reason you had ot use it.
10:42 < odiv> oh, they also made it so it doesn't work in the abyss I think.
10:42 < zackoid> yeah it's purely bad now

13:42 < OCTOTROG> mace and flail ~ maces and flails ~ maces & flails[1/2]: club (+3/5/1.3/0.6), whip (+2/6/1.1/0.5), hammer (+3/7/1.3/0.6), mace (+3/8/1.4/0.7), flail (+0/10/1.4/0.7), demon whip (+1/11/1.1/0.5), sacred scourge (+0/12/1.1/0.5), morningstar (-2/13/1.5/0.7), eveningstar (-1/15/1.5/0.7), dire flail (-3/13/1.3/0.6) [2], great mace (-4/17/1.7/0.7) [2], giant club (-6/20/1.7/0.7) [2],
13:42 < OCTOTROG> giant spiked club (-7/22/1.8/0.7) [2]
13:43 < Hildebrand> dire flail is two handed right?
13:43 < Hildebrand> [2] signifies its two handers, correct?
13:43 < roj> Welcome ot the Mace and Flail, would you like to try one of our nanobrews?
13:43 < roj> I think so, yes.
13:44 < roj> Though It's more complicated than that, no? Aren't there a handful of weapons a larger creature can use one handed?
13:44 < roj> (Dire Flail is not one of them)
13:44 < zackoid> yes it's two-handed
13:45 < zackoid> and yes some weapons are two-handed for small creatures.  it used to be different between small and little characters (bet you didn't know there was such a thing), but they simplified it recently
13:46 < Hildebrand> larger meaning only troll and ogre pretty much?
13:46 < Hildebrand> maybe draconian
13:47 < Hildebrand> ??rod of shadows
13:47 < OCTOTROG> rod of shadows[1/2]: Creates shadow creatures from a Dungeon or Depths level based on your evocations skill. Really bad with low evoc.
13:47 < Hildebrand> ??rod of lightning
13:47 < OCTOTROG> lightning rod[1/2]: Fires a thunderbolt like a regular beam, then when evoked again fires lightning in the space between the first and second beams. Does not multizap.
13:48 < Hildebrand> which rod is better to keep?
13:48 < zackoid> just troll and ogre.
13:48 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L10 MiBe) killed the ghost of Yackwabbit the Covert, a novice OpMo of Dithmenos. (D:8) [cbro+]
13:48 < zackoid> why only one?
13:49 <@slitherrr> ??temporal distortion
13:49 < OCTOTROG> temporal distortion[1/3]: 3* Cheibriados ability. Acts like a very low-duration (3-5 turns) instant step from time, the result of which is that monsters will approach you while you're safe from their ranged attacks. Monsters can also walk through you while you use it, which gives it many, many uses.
13:50 < Hildebrand> i was just wondering cuz i figured being mibe i wont have high evokes
13:50 <@slitherrr> troll and ogre can use giant spiked club, which nothing else can use
13:50 <@slitherrr> your evo will be -1, which is plenty to get it to like 8 or 12 without much effort
13:51 <@slitherrr> esp as mibe, you have nothing else to put skill points in once you're done with the big three
13:52 <@slitherrr> ??temporal distortion[2
13:52 <@slitherrr> ??temporal distortion[3
13:52 < OCTOTROG> temporal distortion[2/3]: Helps making harmful clouds you just got blown over you time out, enemy orbs of destruction fly into walls instead of you, getting ranged monsters closer to you - and even making slime creatures split apart! Use it!
13:52 < OCTOTROG> temporal distortion[3/3]: Other uses include: Moving monsters around in corridors (whether pulling summoners closer or getting a strong monster away from you), parking monsters on other floors (go down stairs, a+b and go up if they're not adjacent), moving monsters off stairs, et cetera
13:54 <@slitherrr> ??step from time
13:54 <@slitherrr> ??slouch
13:54 < OCTOTROG> step from time[1/1]: Moves you to nowhere and lets time pass. During that time, monsters wander away. It needs a lot of Invocations to be reliable, 10 or so should be enough. The amount of time that passes depends on your invocations.
13:54 < OCTOTROG> slouch[1/6]: Does damage to everything in sight (including invisible enemies) that's faster than you. More damage with higher speed difference. Insanely good against everything really fast; Executioners get blown into separate molecules.
13:54 < Hildebrand> which is a point, in my last game i stopped training m+f at 16
13:55 < Hildebrand> do i actually want to cap that out, do i get more damage from weapon attacks by putting more points into it?
13:57 < zackoid> you do but there are better uses for that experience
13:57 < zackoid> especially if you have two rods
14:02 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L10 MiBe) killed Psyche. (D:9) [cbro+]
14:02 <@slitherrr> slouch as a naga is pretty great
14:02 <@slitherrr> you get more damage hildebrand but not so much more that it's usually considered worth it
14:06 < zackoid> slouch is the one time you're happy to see a huge pack of bees

14:22 < zackoid> perhaps you meant deep elf?
14:22 < roj> Yes.

17:59 < zackoid> Hildebrand: what's your skills look like
18:00 < zackoid> probably don't need throwing and evoke if you have those rods

18:00 < Hildebrand> ??rod of shadow
18:00 < OCTOTROG> rod of shadow ~ rod of shadows[1/2]: Creates shadow creatures from a Dungeon or Depths level based on your evocations skill. Really bad with low evoc.
18:01 < zackoid> they do

18:01 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L27 NaWz) entered the Pits of Slime. (Lair:5) [cbro+]
18:01 < Hildebrand> ah
18:01 < zackoid> i'd sink more XP into evoke since shadows is amazing at 15+
18:01 < Hildebrand> so stop with throwing and put more into evoke
18:01 < zackoid> yeah
18:01 < Hildebrand> run evoke at 1x or 2x xp?
18:02 < zackoid> that's not what focusing means, but i'd focus it
18:02 < zackoid> but you're diving your XP seven ways then, i usually limit it to 5 at a time
18:02 < Hildebrand> it changes priorities of how much xp goes into it
18:02 < zackoid> on a be it doesn't matter that much
18:03 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L4 NaWr) killed Natasha. (D:2) [cbro+]

18:06 <@slitherrr> ??rod of shadows[2

19:03 < zackoid> the 10 confusing eye thingies could have gone really badly in the open like that

19:04 < zackoid> because i forgot about it
19:04 < isthmus> oh, I thought you were talking about a new feature
19:05 < zackoid> nah, though it did change a few versions ago
19:05 < zackoid> it only kicks if it's going to drop you next to an enemy now

19:16 < isthmus> my hexer guy just tanked a juggernaut for me
19:16 < zackoid> strong but kinda lame
19:16 < isthmus> I didn't find it lame :)
19:16 < zackoid> and they constantly get in the way of ranged attacks.  but otherwise yeah
19:17 < zackoid> what should i play to try to keep the streak alive?

19:20 < zackoid> GrAM hasn't been won yet, though AM is the worst
19:21 < Hildebrand> ??am
19:21 < OCTOTROG> arcane marksman[1/2]: Warrior-mage class that starts with a ranged weapon (bow, crossbow, sling, throwing), robe, and a {Book of Debilitation}.
19:21 < Hildebrand> eww
19:21 < zackoid> !!stats gram
19:21 < OCTOTROG> Starting stats for GrAM: Str 14 Int 13 Dex 9. Stat gain: si/4
19:21 < johnstein> why is AM the worst?
19:22 < johnstein> I thought it was slitherrr or thenoid who said OgAM was good
19:22 < johnstein> of ash
19:22 < zackoid> the book sucks, and the skill and stat distribution is pretty even
19:22 <@slitherrr> me
19:22 <@slitherrr> and it's totally great
19:22 < johnstein> I remember when I said that last time someone (probably zackoid ) said to do OgWr instead
19:22 < johnstein> so
19:22 < johnstein> !lg . ogwr

19:22 < isthmus> wtf, another hell night with a long sword??
19:23 < isthmus> did they take out hell blades or something?
19:23 < isthmus> I mean demon blades
19:23 < isthmus> ???demon blade
19:23 < OCTOTROG> (long blades; -1 acc / 12 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay). A terrible weapon, forged in the fires of Hell. Can be {bless}ed into a {eudemon blade}. / Base damage is 12 in trunk.
19:23 < zackoid> it's just a really weak start
19:23 <@slitherrr> except large rocks
19:23 < zackoid> though for og of ash the stat distribution makes sense
19:23 <@slitherrr> they are what basically carry you until you get your gsc
19:24 < zackoid> have you tried it since they nerfed throwing?  
19:24 <@slitherrr> when was that?
19:24 <@slitherrr> i remember they nerfed it a while ago
19:24 < zackoid> 18 maybe?
19:24 <@slitherrr> making ranged stuff work like melee stuff
19:24 < zackoid> no more recently than that
19:24 < zackoid> ??large rocks
19:24 < OCTOTROG> large rocks ~ large rock[1/2]: (throwing; 20 dam / base delay 2.0 / 0.7 min delay). A very large and very heavy stone. Only large creatures are capable of throwing it.
19:24 <@slitherrr> can't remember
19:24 < zackoid> 2 base delay now
19:24 < johnstein> zackoid: what was lost?
19:25 <@slitherrr> i've played this tourney
19:25 <@slitherrr> and died, but i was in a hurry and know why i fucked up
19:25 < zackoid> did you notice a difference?
19:25 <@slitherrr> not really
19:25 <@slitherrr> things mostly just die to large rocks
19:25 <@slitherrr> still
19:25 <@slitherrr> in the early game at least
19:25 <@slitherrr> so being slow isn't too big a deal'
19:25 < zackoid> unless you miss
19:25 < isthmus> I am up to six hell knights with LB's, and 0 demon blades
19:26 <@slitherrr> you have corona
19:26 < zackoid> anyway i wasn't saying that AM is universely horrible, it's just really weak.
19:26 <@slitherrr> it's like the one spell you'll use from that book
19:26 < zackoid> for most races hu or wr are better
19:26 < isthmus> I'm going to be killing OOF's with a friggin rapier

08:18 < advil> I guess I should wear that
08:18 < advil> not sure about faith for zin
08:28 < advil> maybe if I use imprison more?
08:30 < zackoid> probably better than the alternatives
08:30 < zackoid> makes the tso shuffle easier if you want a holy weapon
08:30 < advil> true
08:30 < advil> I'm using guardian right now

09:05 < advil> I guess with faith I should just have vit up all the time
09:06 < advil> 30 str + 5 slaying = a fair amount of damage
09:07 < roj> faith seems useful for almost everyone.
09:08 < advil> well, it's best if you're drawing on piety a lot
09:08 < roj> I'm just reading, though.
09:08 < roj> Yeah
09:08 < roj> I'm thinking in terms of god I use, which are the simpler ones with pie-cost abilities.
09:08 < advil> I haven't dipped below ****** for zin without faith, and I'm already using vitalization pretty liberally
09:09 < advil> but zackoid is right that switching to tso (which I may do) it'll be great
09:10 < advil> the +5 slaying on the amulet is still better than guardian in any case
09:10 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) reached level 5 of the Realm of Zot. (Zot:5) [cbro+]
09:12 < zackoid> pretty much the only gods where faith isn't at least good are ones that have 6* abilities/bonuses and that don't use a lot of abilities.  and the ones where it does nothing.
09:13 < advil> imprison and sanctuary draw more piety
09:13 < advil> maybe I should just imprison left and right
09:13 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) entered a ziggurat. (Depths:5) [cbro+]

09:16 < zackoid> does imprison do damage to silver-vulnerable things?  or is it just CC?
09:17 < advil> I doubt it
09:18 < advil> sanctuary does damage to undead/demons tho

12:05 < kimtrucks> yesterday was the -2 ring on D2. I did not feel like immediately rerolling after that. :P
12:07 < zackoid> you should add some stuff to your rc, i was creeping on your game briefly the other day and had some advice but i don't remember what most of it was.
12:08 < zackoid> one was that you can do X-> to move to the closest staircase so you don't need to move there manually
12:08 < kimtrucks> wat
12:08 < kimtrucks> that’s awesome
12:08 < zackoid> but add autofight_stop = 60 and include = hugedmg.rc to your RC.
12:09 < zackoid> that is X, >, enter because my - notation made it look weeird
12:09 < zackoid> also ctrl-f is amazing if you aren't familiar with it
12:09 < kimtrucks> huge damage?
12:09 < kimtrucks> I like CTRL+F, someone told me about shift+G because I was manually crawling up and down D levels to get to next entrance
12:10 < kimtrucks> (it was… time consuming)
12:10 < zackoid> hugedmg is a script that stops you when you get whacked for a big percent of health, and it also tells you how much damage you took from all sources over the last turn
12:10 < zackoid> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/rcfiles/crawl-0.19/hugedmg.rc
12:10 < zackoid> is the script, the include just...includes it
12:11 < zackoid> that combined with autofight_stop, if you use tab for most of your melee fighting (and you should) helps you stop when you're in trouble
12:12 < zackoid> for the same reason you generally don't want to move manually when you are taking lots of steps in a row (such as travelling to the stairs without X>) because, especially with lag, you tend to take lots of turns before you notice that something dangerous is happening
12:12 < zackoid> shift-direction is another safe way to move, it's move in a straight line until you hit a corner, object or enemy

13:45 < odiv> You see here the +6 shillelagh "Devastator" {shatter}
13:45 < odiv> ??devastator
13:45 < OCTOTROG> devastator[1/5]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 8 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay). The shillelagh "Devastator". It's a +6 shillelagh that casts radius 1 shatter when you hit something with it, centered on the thing you hit. Won't hit you or break walls. Spellpower scales with melee damage dealt. Not as noisy as the actual shatter spell (15, same as fireball, instead of 30).
13:46 < zackoid> is this an unrand trove?!

13:49 < odiv> I dunno
13:50 < odiv> yikes
13:50 < odiv> 1.8
13:50 < odiv> guess I shouldn't have stopped training xbows :(
13:50 < zackoid> it's still good for softening things up
13:50 < zackoid> and unless you are planning to do extended you are already more than strong enough to win
13:51 < odiv> yep
13:52 < zackoid> what'd you train all that evoke for?
13:52 < odiv> rods, I was thinking
13:52 < odiv> what else? dodging?
13:52 < odiv> I just kinda left it on for a while
13:53 < zackoid> you didn't have any rods in the dump is why i asked
13:53 < odiv> oh, yeah I dropped them for the trove
13:53 < zackoid> yeah dodging i guess, on a --be it doesn't matter
13:53 < odiv> should've gone xbow, but I figured I was set for that

14:50 < odiv> well hopefully I can streak!
14:51 < zackoid> hmm i take that back, i think AE is better.
14:51 < odiv> Good luck at the bad timing awards.
14:51 < odiv> :|
14:52 < odiv> I need a VM win though anyway.
14:52 < zackoid> it's not a huge difference.
14:52 < zackoid> and if you know how to use OTR or AI it might be better, but i don't.
14:52 < odiv> I'll probably go vehumet (surprise!) even though we already have a vehumet
14:52 < odiv> ?
14:52 < odiv> otr/ai?
14:52 < zackoid> and yeah i figured you'd go vehumet in which case it probably doesn't matter
14:53 < zackoid> olgreb's toxic radiance and alistair's intoxication
14:53 < zackoid> you can see why i didn't type that out.
14:53 < odiv> ah
14:53 < odiv> I don't know if I've used those much
14:53 < zackoid> probs because they suck.  though OTR can be good for mummies and gargoyles i think

15:26 < odiv> rcorr right away
15:28 < roj> ??rcorr
15:28 < OCTOTROG> resist corrosion[1/1]: Provides a 50% save against {corrosion} from {acid}, and halves damage (which itself makes the corrosion less likely). Available as a ring (an amulet in 0.17-), on some randarts, or when quaffing potion of resistance. You will still get corroded, but significantly less.
15:28 < roj> ... is there also a resist acid?
15:28 < roj> ??acid reisistance
15:28 < OCTOTROG> acid reisistance ~ acid resistance[1/1]: see {resist corrosion[2]}
15:28 < roj> Ah, no. okay.
15:30 < zackoid> it is mostly useless until much later in the game
15:30 < zackoid> but might save you from an early acid guy

15:49 < odiv> hmmm
15:49 < odiv> maybe I should go ice
15:49 < kimtrucks> last few games, trog has been exclusively gifting arrows
15:52 < odiv> ammo gifts dont' interfere with weapon gifts iirc
15:52 < odiv> so you might see them more (or less), but weapon gifts aren't affected by them.
15:52 < odiv> unless you mean vs. other types of ammo.
15:53 < odiv> usually trog takes your ranged skill at least a little into account I think.
15:53 < kimtrucks> yeah I generally have a bow
15:53 < kimtrucks> but the last one, where I died by turning myself into a tree
15:53 < kimtrucks> there was a distinct lack of any enchanted heavy armor ot weapons
15:53 < kimtrucks> from any source
15:53 < kimtrucks> it hurt, man

16:03 < odiv> heh
16:05 < odiv> so many shops
16:12 < odiv> 240 gold  a polished falchion
16:12 < odiv> tempting
16:12 < odiv> but I have a +4 trident of freezing
16:12 < odiv> so that's nice
16:12 < odiv> 314 gold  a +3 scimitar of flaming
16:13 < odiv> there's that too, which would be good heading into lair

16:43 < kimtrucks> dang
16:45 < zackoid> pfft weapons are for people that aren't odiv.
16:45 < zackoid> staff of energy is pretty good just to get rid of the annoyance
16:46 < zackoid> i should try a tengu of vehumet some time
16:46 < odiv> yeah, and I have inacc anyway
16:46 < odiv> so an excuse to train a little evoc isn't bad
16:46 < zackoid> i never actually channel because i'm lazy and i don't like training evoke on spellcasters
16:46 < zackoid> err blasters.
16:47 < zackoid> i just like not having to care about food
16:47 < zackoid> the one that really sucks is the staff of power because it's so great you're forced to use it, but it's a huge pain if you like to melee at all
16:47 <@slitherrr> ??lightning scales
16:47 < OCTOTROG> lightning scales[1/2]: +6 naga barding of running with rElec.

18:25 < zackoid> fuuuuuck
18:26 < zackoid> this is unbelievably bad as a qaz worshipper
18:27 < zackoid> with nothing ID'd
18:28 < zackoid> also set off a portal
18:28 < zackoid> and i'm dead
18:32 < advil> early fire is like orcs, and lindwurms if they still exist, plus some uniques
18:32 < advil> stuff with random wands
18:34 < zackoid> lindwurms still exist
18:34 < zackoid> overreacted and burned some consumables i shouldn't have
18:34 < advil> I guess their name already has flavour
18:34 < zackoid> and forgot to take off a teleport ring that really screwed me
18:36 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L11 GrAM) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:10) [cbro+]
18:40 < zackoid> i...do not remember how to play qaz
18:41 < advil> don't move around too much
18:41 < advil> though walking away is pretty good if you have enough clouds
18:42 < advil> I always play mi or ho of qaz though
18:42 < zackoid> what's the rc command to make it so plants getting caught in clouds don't interrupt resting?
18:43 < advil> no idea, I just let them burn
18:43 < advil> or move away

18:53 < zackoid> how do i deal with snorg
18:54 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) reached level 7 of a ziggurat. (Zig:7) [cbro+]
18:56 <@laceratedsky> you stab him with the pointy end
18:56 < zackoid> tore through 45AC like paper
18:57 < zackoid> and throwing all my piety at him, almost literally, did nothing
18:57 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) reached level 8 of a ziggurat. (Zig:8) [cbro+]
18:58 < zackoid> god dammit.
19:00 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L13 GrAM) entered an ice cave. (Lair:5) [cbro+]
19:04 < zackoid> is there an ice fiend in THIS cave?
19:07 < advil> I don't usually fight snorg
19:08 < zackoid> me either
19:09 < zackoid> but running away is kinda hard
19:09 < zackoid> and i need to be able to stair dance.  i gave up and dove without clearing most of the level and nearly died immediately
19:09 < zackoid> heh, how does cloud immunity interact with catoblepas dust now?
19:09 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L13 GrAM) reached level 6 of the Lair of Beasts. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
19:09 < advil> did they change cloud immunity?  It should only be clouds you generate
19:12 < zackoid> yes, because there's no way to tell your clouds from others
19:12 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) reached level 9 of a ziggurat. (Zig:9) [cbro+]
19:12 < zackoid> i believe
19:12 < advil> that would be really op, actually
19:14 < zackoid> would it?  how many things generate clouds?

19:17 < OCTOTROG> laceratedsky (L1 MiBe) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
19:18 < zackoid> heh, i just got myself in a possibly-game-ending situation because of a qaz noise interaction i'd never thought of before
19:18 < zackoid> i dug through a wall after a death yak suprised me by going 3 tiles around to block my escape route
19:18 < zackoid> and there was a yak waiting on the other side
19:19 < zackoid> which i can't imagine happens normally
19:19 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) reached level 11 of a ziggurat. (Zig:11) [cbro+]
19:19 < advil> I had antennae on a ds with qazlal, it was actually fairly interesting
19:19 < advil> to see what they did on the other sides of walls
19:19 < advil> gives you a sense for where it might be safe to rest, too, because you can see where they get trapped moving towards noise
19:20 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) killed the ghost of fantismo the Slayer, a legendary HOFi of Cheibriados. (Zig:11) [cbro+]
19:22 < zackoid> i can tell you 100% i was not expecting that hole to be instantly filled with yak
19:22 < zackoid> hmm, i probably shouldn't figure out if immunity applies to dust
19:23 < advil> it's going to depend on how thorough the implementation was and exactly how dust works
19:23 < advil> clouds are pretty weird in the code
19:25 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) reached level 12 of a ziggurat. (Zig:12) [cbro+]
19:26 < zackoid> heh
19:26 < zackoid> speaking of code, i haven't noticed my resistance adaptation kicking in...
19:27 < zackoid> should i bother training doding with 11 dex in chain?
19:27 < advil> really?
19:27 < advil> it looks like petrify clouds should be fine
19:27 < advil> that is, I think you should be immune to them
19:28 < advil> have you had any ac adaptation?
19:29 < zackoid> yeah, and i was kidding.  i only had it briefly before i tanked my piety again
19:29 < advil> oh heh
19:29 < OCTOTROG> JerBear56 (L27 GrBe) reached level 13 of a ziggurat. (Zig:13) [cbro+]
19:30 < zackoid> god dammit
19:30 < zackoid> the same two things that nearly killed me when i got shafted
19:31 < zackoid> and the noise makes things so much smarter about following you

22:07 < odiv> hmmm
22:07 < odiv> confusing touch?
22:07 < odiv> ??confusing touch
22:07 < OCTOTROG> confusing touch[1/3]: A level 1 Hexes spell that makes your hands "glow red" for 10 + d(power) / 5 (max 20) turns. While the status is up, your unarmed attacks do no damage but are slightly more accurate. If you hit a monster with no weapon wielded, it has a chance to get confused and the status to end.
22:07 < odiv> that's mildly tempting
22:08 < odiv> oh pft
22:08 < odiv> no damage?

22:24 < odiv> so...
22:24 < odiv> do I go heavy armour?

22:25 < odiv> ??unarmed
22:26 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[1/3]: Fighting without a weapon. Base damage is 3 + UC skill (+2 per claws level (so +6 Tr, +2 Gh), +X for forms); delay 1.0 - UC/54.0; +2 to hit.
22:26 < odiv> ??unarmed[2
22:26 < isthmus> you could peek into hell and hope for a demon whio

22:26 < zackoid> there are more branded demon tridents then branded maces that aren't protection
22:26 < zackoid> by 2.
22:26 < odiv> hm
22:27 < zackoid> should i just skill up polearms from 0?

22:28 < OCTOTROG> demon trident[1/1]: (polearms; +1 acc / 12 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay). A terrible three-pronged weapon, moulded by fire and brimstone. Can be {bless}ed into a {trishula}.

22:28 < odiv> qazlal
22:29 < odiv> found a +7str helmet with sinv and rcorr that barring surprises I'll wear the rest of the game.
22:29 < zackoid> +7?!!
22:29 < zackoid> oh, i misread
22:29 < zackoid> that's strength.
22:29 < isthmus> hmm, in my opinion you can go whichever way you want
22:29 < odiv> light armour would let me cast easier
22:30 < zackoid> i think armour choice is defined by your str (lots) and spells (none, because qaz needs lots of invoke)
22:30 < odiv> but as a ds I don't really wan tto go spreading xp around too much.
22:30 < isthmus> but I am not a number cruncher when it comes to skills and stats
22:30 < odiv> found hexes book with confusing touch
22:30 < odiv> which seems like if I'm going to use it on any character it'd be with unarmed
22:31 < isthmus> personally I'd be inclined to go with heavy armour for qaz
22:31 < odiv> Yeah, that's what I've been thinking
22:31 < odiv> enough str I can maybe cast anyway if I need ot.
22:31 < odiv> to
22:31 < isthmus> but that's why my qaz character is not a demonspawn
22:31 < odiv> what do I need invoc for?
22:31 < isthmus> qaz ability's damage apparently scales really well with invoc
22:31 < isthmus> all the way up to 27
22:32 < odiv> cool, thanks
22:32 < odiv> I also have bone plates
22:32 < odiv> bone plates + qaz SH
22:32 < isthmus> good one to have
22:32 < odiv> do I even need a shield?
22:32 < Hildebrand> U - the ring "Totuoh" {rCorr Str+3 Int+2}
22:32 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L22 GrAM) entered the Depths. (D:15) [cbro+]
22:33 < isthmus> if you go unarmed, consider it if you find a really nice shield or buckler (reflection or artefact, or elemental resistance that you need)
22:33 < isthmus> or if you go with weapon, consider it if you find a good one-hander
22:33 < zackoid> heh, think the DT is better with 0 skill than the flail
22:33 < odiv> I'm already committed to unarmed
22:33 < odiv> claws 3 by like XL6 or whatever is a pretty good sign
22:33 < Hildebrand> is it possible that you can get a ice caves that times out before you even get to the level?
22:33 < isthmus> ok, try a buckler versus no buckler and see how it feels to you
22:34 < zackoid> bucklers costs nothing
22:34 < Hildebrand> i swear it looks like i have an ice caves level just never got a message for it
22:34 < zackoid> and Ds is great for qaz because of that invoke apt
22:34 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L9 DsMo) killed Joseph. (D:8) [cbro+]
22:34 < zackoid> and confusing touch is level 1, you can cast it in CPA
22:34 < isthmus> does it actually work?
22:34 < Hildebrand> how do you bring up the message log again?
22:34 < isthmus> I've never used it much
22:35 < isthmus> control-p
22:35 < odiv> is confusing touch something I'd want even?
22:35 < odiv> seems like it's not that bad an idea.
22:35 < odiv> 8SH without buckler, 13SH with.
22:36 < isthmus> if you just have a generic +0 buckler, I would forget it until I started thinking "I am being hit way too often"
22:36 < isthmus> if you find a nice buckler I'd use it\
22:37 < odiv> ^dump
22:37 < Hildebrand> yeah, nothing in the log for an ice cave

22:37 < Hildebrand> but i have blue ice looking tiles all over, and what looks like it was supposed to be an ice cave entrance
22:38 < isthmus> no idea, hildebrand
22:38 < zackoid> it's ridiculous how much damage you can take through 52AC and 22SH

11:40 < apoch> er, they weren't summons
11:41 < zackoid> yeah the UI on summons isn't great, but it's better than it used to be.  it'll also say in xv if you're not sure.
11:41 < zackoid> what's really fun is when there are multiple summoners and you don't know which one to kill.

11:46 < apoch> Yeah, can't let people have fun
11:47 < zackoid> i mean because berserkers are already stupid overpowered, and banning them from spells but giving them access to every spell effect through evocations was dumb

11:47 < johnstein> ??abjuration

12:10 < OCTOTROG> swamp[1/3]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere between levels 2 and 5. Four levels deep. Expect watery terrain and hydras throughout. A decaying rune lies at the bottom, usually guarded by swamp dragons and hydras. As swamp drakes emit mephitic clouds, you may want to have poison resistance or enhanced mental clarity.
12:11 < kimtrucks> ??snake pit
12:11 < OCTOTROG> snake pit[1/3]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere between levels 3 and 6. Four levels deep. The serpentine rune lies at the bottom, and the greater nagas are renowned for their charm and hospitality. Half of all games contain this branch; the others contain {Spider Nest}.

12:15 < valrus> that's a terrifying message to see
12:16 < zackoid> huh i don't remember that being a thing
12:17 < valrus> maybe it's only if you take it off the floor you bribed it on?
12:17 < zackoid> possily
12:17 < zackoid> ??bribe branch
12:17 < OCTOTROG> bribe branch[1/1]: Gozag ability which costs 3000 gold. While active, monsters have a chance to become either friendly or "good-neutral" (like freed slaves) when seeing you, until your money wears out, upon which time they become pacified.

12:29 < zackoid> i can't figure out in the code what sets off unbribing, just how it does.

12:29 < zackoid> it hits a lot of files.
12:29 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L16 MiBe) killed Aizul. (Snake:1) [cbro+]
12:30 < zackoid> there's something about a timeout but i think that's just for pacification

12:48 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L16 OgAM) killed Aizul. (Snake:1) [cbro+]
12:48 < valrus> I had a hard time with hells until I farmed pan for a while
12:49 < zackoid> i never know how much of pan i should clear, i suspect i always do too much
12:49 < zackoid> which contributes to not doing extended very much, which makes me unsure in extended, which makes me overclear, etc
12:50 < valrus> I've only done a handful of 15-runes but if I'm not explicitly trying to farm I leave pan forever as soon as I've gotten all the runes
12:50 < valrus> and usually take the first pan portal I see in any level that doesn't have one
12:50 < odiv> I miss pan.
12:50 < odiv> I haven't 15 runed in like... 3-4 years?
12:51 < odiv> I did do pan without hells once.
12:51 < odiv> but that was also a couple years ago.

13:48 < valrus> looking at the rationale. can't disagree!
13:48 < odiv> glad I got my win in!
13:48 < valrus> especially since I was planning to lean on her for an easy win hohoho
13:48 < kimtrucks> what’s the rationale?
13:49 < odiv> wands are already pretty powerful, pakellas makes them effectively limitless and more powerful.
13:49 < kimtrucks> ??pakellas
13:49 < OCTOTROG> pakellas[1/3]: Pakellas the Inventive, god of devices; added in 0.18, disabled in 0.19 pending rework or removal. Blocks MP regeneration and hates channeling; instead you get access to MP on kills, {quick charge}, {device surge}, and gifts of evokables. At 6*, you also get a one-off {supercharge} of a wand or rod.

18:12 < zackoid> ??sh
18:12 < OCTOTROG> shield[1/5]: Wearing a shield gives you a chance to block all damage from some attacks, including arrows, melee, and some spells. Shields prevent off-hand attacks, and until you have enough skill they also slow your melee attacks and make it harder to cast spells.

18:15 < OCTOTROG> shield[2/5]: You need 4/15/25 skill to eliminate evasion, melee speed, and casting penalties for bucklers/shields/large shields for normal races, 5.6/21/- for kobolds and halflings, 7.2/-/- for spriggans, 2.4/9/15 for nagas, centaurs, and formicids, -/9/15 for trolls and ogres.
18:15 < zackoid> ??sh[3

Every level of shield skill increases SH by 1/20 of the base shield value. You get an effective SH bonus based on your str and dex (large and regular) or dex (for bucklers).
18:16 < zackoid> ??sh[4
18:16 < OCTOTROG> shield[4/5]: You will block a missile if a random number up to 130% of the missile to-hit is less than a random number (on 2 dice) up to 2/3 of your SH; a melee instead uses a random number up to 15 + to-hit / 2. Both to-pass-shield values are inflated by 5 * (previous blocks this turn)^2.
18:16 < zackoid> ??sh[5
18:16 < OCTOTROG> shield formulas[1/2]: Adjusted shield evasion penalty = base penalty - (shield skill / (5 + size factor))

11:54 < kimtrucks> yea
11:54 < odiv> why both armour/dodging?
11:54 < kimtrucks> soon, maces & flails will stop training
11:54 < kimtrucks> sooooon
11:54 < odiv> turn off hte latter prolly
11:54 < odiv> unless you're going light?
11:54 < zackoid> ??kryia's
11:54 < OCTOTROG> kryia's ~ kryias ~ kryia's mail coat[1/1]: The +7 Kryia's mail coat {DeviceHeal*2 rC+}. Base type is scale mail. DeviceHeal*2 means that potions and wands will heal you twice as much as they would otherwise. That means VS gets no benefit. Deep dwarves also get no benefit to prevent swapping.
11:55 < odiv> zackoid: just fine that?
11:55 < odiv> find
11:55 < zackoid> kim has it
11:55 < kimtrucks> sadly, no heal wands yet
11:55 < odiv> ohh
11:55 < odiv> sweet
11:55 < zackoid> it's a pretty obscure ability but +7 scale of rC+ is pretty good
11:57 < zackoid> kimtrucks: once it works you should play around with blink.  it is absurdly powerful because it means you can walk away from any monster that is the same speed as you (blink to create a gap then walk).  
11:57 < zackoid> also absurdly powerful with a ranged weapon because you can blink-kite
11:57 < OCTOTROG> Hildebrand (L10 MiBe) killed the ghost of Thrax the Grappler, a novice TrBe of Trog. (D:9) [cbro+]
11:57 < kimtrucks> yup, I’ve been goofing on blind to get me out of bad situations
11:57 < kimtrucks> saved me once
11:57 < kimtrucks> which I could control it like a Blind Scroll though
11:57 < kimtrucks> *Blink
11:57 < zackoid> well there's a reason that controlled blink is a level 8 spell, heh
11:57 < zackoid> RIP semi-controlled blink
11:58 < zackoid> but even uncontrolled is great, you just have to not wait until a bad blink will kill you to use it
11:58 < zackoid> blink-kiting a juggernaut with a character that is could one-shot is fun
11:58 < zackoid> it
11:59 < kimtrucks> can you telefrag yourself with uncontrolled blink?
11:59 < zackoid> no it won't blink into lava or deep water
11:59 < zackoid> it will blink it to dangerous clouds, i think
12:00 < zackoid> Advanced Blinking is to deliberately move to change your line-of-sight to change the odds of how you blink
12:00 < zackoid> but that'll take time, i still don't make good use of that
12:04 < kimtrucks> hm, interesting
12:04 < kimtrucks> thanks
12:05 < kimtrucks> is price directly correlated to quality of enchantment or is it randomized within enchantment bands?

12:41 < zackoid> kimtrucks: weapon brands?
12:42 < kimtrucks> I’m looking to see if I have found any rPois anywhere to help me through the Pit
12:42 < zackoid> i usually do weapontype & ego, so mace & ego shows all branded maces.  if that's what you mean by search.
12:42 < zackoid> rPois should find, it or poison resistance
12:42 < zackoid> they improved the searching for resistances tremendously last version
12:42 < zackoid> maybe rPois+?
12:42 < kimtrucks> nope, no rPois
12:43 < kimtrucks> anywhere, on 15 levels of dungeon/6 levels of lair/1 level of Snake
12:43 < kimtrucks> lots of rF
12:43 < odiv> and orcs
12:43 < zackoid> you can also try armour && ego and see if there's any armours you haven't tested that might have it

12:49 < kimtrucks> odiv using bows, just prefer to back away and whack people with my mace to enforce the idea that my first instinct should ALWAYS be luring
12:49 < kimtrucks> as I can get overconfident otherwise
12:49 < odiv> i usually fire bows while they come at me
12:49 < kimtrucks> and don’t worry about asking questions; I appreciate it
12:49 < odiv> bro
12:49 < odiv> also do you know the ' weapon swap thing?

13:08 < zackoid> aww
13:10 < zackoid> i was just looking at the options guide and one that i'm definitely adding is hp_warning = 25.  the default is 10, which is really low.
13:10 < odiv> but yeah, for ranged fog is decent in future.
13:10 < odiv> also I think they're slow, so you can usually just walk away a bit
13:10 < odiv> in order to heal, pop haste, w/e
13:10 < odiv> anyway, don't want to post-mortem too much. Good run!

14:56 < odiv> it's nice!
14:57 < zackoid> are you gonna tornado or fire storm or do you not know yet?
14:57 < zackoid> or...POISON STORM
14:57 < odiv> I'm hoping for both yeah
14:58 < TheNoid> Poison needs some high level spells.
14:58 < odiv> something acid related?
14:59 < odiv> I wish I had fireball
14:59 < zackoid> acid spells are on the Won'T Do
15:00 < zackoid> (though they've done stuff off the Won'T Do before)
15:00 < zackoid> parrow is really good if you have a ton of conj already

15:03 < zackoid> maybe i've forgotten how much the boost is
15:04 < odiv> oh, no probably not
15:04 < odiv> fire storm first
15:04 < odiv> though tornado is easier to get to
15:04 < odiv> I guess
15:05 < zackoid> for tengoos definitely
15:05 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L13 TeVM) killed Harold. (Lair:2) [cbro+]
15:05 < zackoid> like half the cost
15:06 < odiv> if so then maybe both are castable by endgame. :P

15:08 < zackoid> isn't that good?
15:09 < TheNoid> You can just take it off at max piety. I don't think you'll lose anything.
15:10 < zackoid> looks like the chance to regain MP is piety-based, but i think you can live with that for a bit after you pop the final gifts
15:12 < OCTOTROG> sleevener (L1 GhNe) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
15:12 < zackoid> odiv: how's your double-zapping?  i'm horrible at it.\
15:12 < odiv> it doesn't matter too much.
15:13 < odiv> I think they changed the code and now it's more annoying to do.
15:14 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L1 OpIE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
15:16 < kimtrucks> double-zapping?
15:16 < odiv> lightning bounces
15:16 < odiv> off of walls
15:16 < OCTOTROG> valrus (L14 KoWr) reached level 6 of the Lair of Beasts. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
15:16 < odiv> so you can sometimes get it to hit an enemy twice
15:16 < kimtrucks> oh cool, thanks
15:17 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L16 VpEE) entered the Orcish Mines. (D:11) [cbro+]
15:17 < zackoid> you can also get it to hit an enemy, a wall, an enemy and then yourself!
15:18 < odiv> yay!
15:18 < zackoid> which is my most common double-zap method.
15:18 < odiv> but yeah,, I think they changed it so it tries to mimic your first double zap
15:18 < OCTOTROG> sleevener (L4 GhNe) killed Ijyb. (D:2) [cbro+]
15:18 < odiv> but it doesn't show up properly on console
15:18 < odiv> so I'll move the cursor to double zap again, but it's already in the right spot, so it's now too far and I have to move it back.
15:19 < zackoid> but isn't that an improvement, once you get used to it?  or i'm reading wrong
15:19 < odiv> sure, if I could trust that the cursor is in fact in the right spot and not where it says it is.
15:19 < zackoid> guess i don't understand, but also nevermind because i don't think i ever will
15:19 < odiv> it looks like it's on top of the monster as normal.
15:20 < odiv> I'll move it to be a double zap, but it will be too far
15:20 < odiv> oh ok nm. :P
15:20 < odiv> next time I'm going to cast I'll let you know
15:20 < odiv> maybe I'll look at it on web
15:20 < odiv> I'm working now though. Lunch is over.

18:14 < OCTOTROG> ghoul[1/3]: Player ghouls have claws 1 (see {unarmed combat}), rN+++, rC+, poison and torment immunity. They also rot over time. Eating chunks can cure rot and/or restore HP. Monster ghouls are quite powerful, have a ton of HP, and rot you.
18:15 <@slitherrr> ??ghoul[2
18:15 <@slitherrr> ??ghoul[3
18:15 < OCTOTROG> ghoul[2/3]: Spells player ghouls can't use: revivification, death's door, stoneskin, any form-changing spell (including blade hands and necromutation), and spells that would have no useful effect such as cure poison.
18:15 < OCTOTROG> ghoul[3/3]: You smell decay. Yum-yum.

18:20 <@slitherrr> ??unarmed combat
18:20 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[1/3]: Fighting without a weapon. Base damage is 3 + UC skill (+2 per claws level (so +6 Tr, +2 Gh), +X for forms); delay 1.0 - UC/54.0; +2 to hit.
18:20 <@slitherrr> ??unarmed combat[2
18:20 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[2/3]: Base for forms: Normal/Hog 3, Spider 5 (venom), Bat 1, Vampire Bat 2 (vamp), Ice 12 (freezing), Blade 8 + (str + dex) / 3, Statue (6 + str / 3), Dragon 18 + str*2/3, Lich 5 (drain). Form base damage scales with skill, just like normal punches.
18:20 <@slitherrr> ??unarmed combat[3
18:20 < OCTOTROG> auxiliary attacks[1/4]: Auxiliary attacks are /extra/ melee attacks using body parts. You can get auxiliary attacks by having hooves, horns, talons, fangs, a beak, or a large muscular tail. Unarmed Combat skill does not affect these. However, if you have Unarmed Combat skill and are not using a shield or two-handed weapon, you do get an offhand punch.

21:22 < OCTOTROG> dispersal[1/3]: Spell: All monsters that are adjacent to you will be instantly teleported away if they don't resist (via magic resistance). If a monster does resist, it will be blinked instead (even if it's immune!). Does not work on -TELE enemies such as statues.
21:22 < OCTOTROG> regen2 ~ regen ~ regeneration[1/8]: Increases the rate at which you regain HP per turn. Regeneration doesn't work when you're {sick}; instead it makes Sickness disappear faster.
21:22 < zackoid> ??regen[2
21:22 < OCTOTROG> regeneration[2/8]: The base regeneration rate is your maximum hitpoints / 3. If this number is over 20, then divide the result by two and add ten. For example, 100 max health results in a regen rate of 26. RR accumulates every turn and for every 100 RR you gain, you regenerate 1 hp. For 1 hp per turn, 540 health is needed. For 1 hp per 2 turns, 240.
21:22 < zackoid> ??regen[3
21:23 < OCTOTROG> regeneration[3/8]: An amulet or troll leather armour adds 40 to your rr, player mutation 20 per level, and the status effect (spell) 100. What this means is that an amulet of regen or troll leather armour effectively doubles your healing rate (or better) for most characters.
21:24 < zackoid> when i've been watching mibes ths week i've seen a lot of people popping trog's hand for the regen before the fight starts, but that really doesn't help much, right?  unless it's a very long fight
21:24 < isthmus> well, if you have to run, it's already going
21:24 < johnstein> hm. I always did that
21:24 < isthmus> and any edge helps
21:24 < johnstein> till I realized there was a piety cost
21:25 < zackoid> it helps but it's not cheap
21:25 < johnstein> then I started being miserly
21:25 < johnstein> and saved for MR
21:25 < johnstein> which I didn't even realize was a perk for many games
21:25 < isthmus> sure... I'd do it for a tough fight
21:25 < johnstein> ie I thought it was mostly for hp regen. pretty sad

21:25 < johnstein> yay
21:25 < zackoid> i'm not saying never use it but i think most people don't have a good sense for how slow regen is even with regen, when you're talking about a single fight's worth of turns
21:25 < johnstein> love that yellow text
21:26 < TheNoid> It's beautiful isn't it?

21:40 < zackoid> isthmus: my qaz game was like that, used a mace of protect until like vaults:3
21:40 < zackoid> but i had really good armour at least
21:41 < isthmus> best thing I've had so far: the entrance to Depths forms a natural killhole
21:41 < zackoid> i ended up training up a demon trident even though i had 16 m&f
21:41 < isthmus> I thought about switching over for wyrmbane
21:41 < zackoid> i would, it's so cheap
21:42 < zackoid> in fact i've done that before.  on a mummy!
21:42 < isthmus> heh
21:42 < isthmus> sure, why not
21:42 < isthmus> I do have +1 apt
21:42 < zackoid> it's only 12 for wyrmbane
21:42 < zackoid> getting to 14 with a -1 apt was 2.5 levels of depths
21:42 < isthmus> definitely will then
21:42 < isthmus> for Zot ifnothing else
21:43 < isthmus> and I really really could use those resistances

21:47 < isthmus> took 6 upheavals and some extra
21:47 < zackoid> let that be a lesson to you
21:47 < zackoid> don't take my advice
21:47 < isthmus> we'll see, if wyrmbane pays off you will be at 50%
21:48 < zackoid> it's already at mindelay
21:48 < isthmus> wow nice
21:48 < zackoid> i always forget what cross-trains
21:49 < zackoid> rC+ for +rage is a good trade, but it looks like it's only AC+3 now
21:49 < zackoid> still probably the best weapon in the game outside of crazy randarts

13:07 < zackoid> ??confusing touch
13:07 < OCTOTROG> confusing touch[1/3]: A level 1 Hexes spell that makes your hands "glow red" for 10 + d(power) / 5 (max 20) turns. While the status is up, your unarmed attacks do no damage but are slightly more accurate. If you hit a monster with no weapon wielded, it has a chance to get confused and the status to end.
13:08 < zackoid> ??confusing touch[2
13:08 < OCTOTROG> confusing touch[2/3]: Non-living monsters and plant monsters are unconfusable. 1/5th of the time, nothing happens. Otherwise, if the monster's HD is greater than or equal to random2(30) (random2(22) if a demon/angel/undead, wtf), nothing happens. Otherwise, it gets confused. If it doesn't get confused, the status doesn't end.

14:18 <@slitherrr> ??the shining one
14:18 < OCTOTROG> the shining one[1/10]: One of three 'good gods'. Provides a number of passive favors as well as active abilities later. Enjoys killing of evil creatures, and forbids poison, evil/unholy magic or items, attacking distracted or sleeping intelligent creatures, and cannibalism.
14:18 <@slitherrr> ??the shining one[2
14:18 < OCTOTROG> the shining one[2/10]: Passive abilities include occasionally intervening to save your life, gradual increase of natural rN+, and healing and MP recovery sometimes on kills of evil, demonic, or undead beings. You will also gain a "halo" within which all other beings are easier to hit (and rendered visible); it gradually increases in range with your piety.
14:18 <@slitherrr> ??the shining one[3
14:18 < OCTOTROG> the shining one[3/10]: Active abilities include strengthening your shield, blasting the surrounding area with cleansing flame, and summoning friendly Angels or Daevas to fight with you. All these abilities cost piety, however, and the better ones depend heavily on your Invocations skill to work properly.
14:18 <@slitherrr> ??the shining one[4
14:18 < OCTOTROG> the shining one[4/10]: The final ability TSO gives (at ****** piety) is the opportunity to have a single weapon blessed. Blessing a weapon replaces its brand with holy wrath, and raises enchantment level by 2. If the weapon is a demon blade, a demon trident, or a demon whip, its base stats will be enhanced as well: see {eudemon blade}, {trishula}, {sacred scourge}.
14:19 <@slitherrr> come on give me what i want
14:19 <@slitherrr> ??the shining one[5
14:19 < OCTOTROG> the shining one[5/10]: TSO allows poison magic under some circumstances; casting Poison Arrow on unpoisonable enemies, for example, or casting Mephitic Cloud on yourself. This is probably not very helpful.
14:19 <@slitherrr> :/
14:19 <@slitherrr> ??divine shield
14:19 < OCTOTROG> divine shield[1/1]: The Shining One ability that temporarily increases your SH. Stacks with your actual shield if you're wearing one.. The piety cost is randomly 2 or 3. Gives 3 + Invo/5 SH.

04:19 < johnstein> ??armour
04:20 < OCTOTROG> armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.
04:20 < johnstein> ??armour[2
04:20 < OCTOTROG> armour[2/4]: Torment, smite, damnation, electrocution, and a handful of other abilities/effects ignore AC. The only player-castable damage spells that ignore AC are freeze, refrigeration, sticky flame, static discharge, pain, vampiric draining, Olgreb's Toxic Radiance, ignite poison, and agony. Note that all of these spells also ignore EV.
04:20 < johnstein> ??armour[3

10:56 < advil> apparently mara lacks rtomahawk?
10:57 < advil> that was entirely tomahawk damage
10:57 < advil> never would have expected that to be effective
11:00 < zackoid> how much throw skill?
11:00 < advil> 12
11:02 < zackoid> huh
11:25 < zackoid> advil: how obnoxious is zin's food conduct if you use him the whole game?
11:26 < advil> it's a bit obnoxious, there's nothing to eat down here
11:26 < advil> I've been roughly holding steady at about 10 rations in store though
11:27 < OCTOTROG> advil (L25 HOGl) killed the Enchantress. (Depths:3) [cbro+]
11:28 < advil> I can eat: caustic shrikes, dragons
11:29 < zackoid> that sounds unpleseant.  the reflux must be terrible.

11:32 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/advil/advil.txt [cbro]
11:33 < zackoid> you went to slime:5 but didn't get the rune?
11:33 < advil> the trj fight didn't go well, I bailed
11:34 < advil> I went in there after being blocked by mara and then red drained by a blademaster, really needed xp
11:34 < advil> and slime is pretty ok for a zin char
11:34 < zackoid> slimes are unclean?
11:35 < advil> yeah, lots of piety in there and you don't get mutated
11:35 < advil> plus I have good rc
11:36 < zackoid> they should increase the enchant level on faerieda
11:38 < zackoid> i wonder how it's generated
11:38 < advil> I think it's partly that mottled has a pretty low max
11:39 < zackoid> yeah but it almost always rolls +0 or +1 for me
11:39 < zackoid> and even amazing randart properties usually are not enough when you are in a situation where you'd wear mottled
11:39 < zackoid> you usually really need the AC
11:40 < zackoid> if it was centered on +4 it'd be a lot cooler
11:40 < advil> my gear situation is not really ideal but that one wasn't going to help
11:40 < zackoid> are you going to switch to FDA soon?  or are you enchantless?
11:41 < advil> I spend all my scrolls on this ida
11:41 < advil> not sure what I'll do in zot
11:41 < zackoid> can you get to rF+ with it?
11:41 < advil> yeah with tradeoffs
11:41 < zackoid> with orc HP it should be doable
11:41 < advil> have to wear rF and ring of fire
11:41 < advil> or wield this exec axe
11:41 < zackoid> well maybe v:5 or slime:5 will have an rF item
11:42 < zackoid> i did zot with rF- chain recently, but i had qaz adaptation and like 70AC
11:44 < zackoid> ??vitalisation
11:44 < OCTOTROG> vitalisation[1/1]: Protects you from sickness, poison, confusion, petrification, rot and stat drain while active, and boosts your stats (up to +9 each, depending on Invoc skill).

11:45 < OCTOTROG> juggernaut[1/1]: They hit extremely hard (120 max damage!) and have very high AC and HP. They also move fast. However, they swing very slowly. Make the most of the time you get after a swing.
11:45 < advil> did they change that?
11:45 < zackoid> in what sense?
11:46 < zackoid> they moved it from 1 big attack to 2 biggish attacks, but that was last version i think
11:46 < advil> ah
11:46 < advil> they don't seem as bad but one did just hit me for a lot

11:50 < zackoid> ?
11:50 < odiv> Yeah, I went yesterday and got felt up.

11:50 < zackoid> yeesh
11:51 < odiv> if it gets much worse today or tomorrow I might go in to emergency.
11:51 < zackoid> did you get a donut?
11:51 < odiv> We just upgraded shit at work.
11:51 < odiv> and two of us are away.
11:51 < advil> Y - a wand of hasting {zapped: 1}

11:51 < advil> finally
11:51 < odiv> I guess if I sit still it shouldn't b etoo bad.
11:51 < advil> that sounds pretty unpleasant odiv
11:52 < odiv> But I'm worried about my capacity for patience. :P
11:53 < zackoid> a donut pillow, though doughnuts help soothe pain too.
11:54 < odiv> haha
11:54 < odiv> I was like, "Good idea. I could use a doughtnut."
11:58 < zackoid> aww, snow was downgraded from 8-12" to 3-5".  i like when it snows when i have nowhere to be
11:59 < advil> huh, we got upgraded
11:59 < advil> we = ottawa
12:00 < advil> I guess I should give trj another shot

13:53 < advil> would've been a good character to take into extended
13:54 < advil> I think that should push us to #19, and the current #19 doesn't have any games going that could win in time
13:55 < advil> though another team could catch up

14:59 < zackoid> oh no

15:00 < johnstein> whatever
15:00 < johnstein> I just didn't have enough time to play
15:01 < johnstein> I was diving diving diving
15:01 < johnstein> surprised I made it that far
15:01 < johnstein> wish I had just not tried
15:01 < johnstein> and had the character alive so I could have had a fairly easy win
15:01 < johnstein> didn't do crypt
15:01 < johnstein> or V:5
15:01 < johnstein> or a zig
15:01 < johnstein> or U4 or U5
15:02 < johnstein> I almost saw the orb

15:06 < zackoid> kinda want to build up a zig-clearer, but also don't
15:06 < zackoid> advil: how important is channeling?
15:06 < advil> very
15:06 < advil> at least for one like mine
15:07 < advil> I'm not actually sure how you would construct a zig-clearer like mine without clarity
15:07 < advil> less necromutation maybe
15:09 < zackoid> people somehow do it without big nukers
15:09 < advil> probably nearly all of the cboe/staff of energy evokes in my log (77 / 43 respectively) were in the zig I cleared
15:09 < advil> yeah it's possible with other builds
15:09 < advil> staff of energy is to get things started if cboe drains your mp
15:09 < advil> makhleb instead of vehumet maybe?
15:09 < advil> or tso melee, with lots of fog?
15:10 < zackoid> on the lower floors you can't blink through until you've cleared some?
15:10 < advil> it would be possible
15:11 < advil> probably something other than DE would allow a bit more flexibility

15:17 < OCTOTROG> 3 games for johnstein (xl=27 !won): 2x MfSk, GrBe
15:18 < zackoid> it's tornado + firestorm that are the most common?
15:18 < zackoid> or is shatter better despite the flying thing
15:18 < johnstein> !lg . xl=27 !won t s=char
15:18 < advil> firestorm is way, way better than shatter
15:18 < OCTOTROG> One game for johnstein (xl=27 !won t): MfSk
15:18 < advil> because firestorm provides crowd control, too
15:19 < zackoid> yeah i meant firestorm + what
15:19 < zackoid> but wrote it backwards
15:19 < advil> ah I would think tornado is still better than shatter
15:20 < advil> I had all three, and shatter was the least used in the zig
15:20 < advil> on some floors it kills everything though
15:20 < advil> and fog + shatter is a pretty helpful panic button (saved my life on a tomb floor in the first zig I tried)
15:20 < zackoid> dangerous floors are mummy, panlord and zot?
15:21 < advil> there's other dangerous things, depending
15:21 < zackoid> what was your silence strategy?
15:21 < advil> fire, slime, abyss, elf floors can be bad
15:22 < advil> iirc  I cast tornado out of silence range mostly?
15:22 < advil> if it were a different character I would have collected penetration javelins or something
15:22 < advil> silence is manageable for a regular zig, I think a megazig is where it starts to get really bad
15:25 < advil> I wonder how much firestorm no longer working out of los matters
15:28 < zackoid> has that changed since you did one?

16:31 < odiv> and take a demon blade to mindelay or something.
16:33 < zackoid> do you use inner flame ever?
16:34 < apoch> Only when I'm chilly

17:55 < zackoid> pretty good, but this is the easy part of the game for blasters
17:55 < zackoid> vehumets gifts have been mostly useful which is nice, i usually have bad luck with them
17:55 < zackoid> wondering if i should bother learning throw icicle or lightning bolt from books
18:05 < zackoid> the only thing i have for rf enemies right now is battlesphere
18:15 < odiv> battlesphere + dart is more useful than I thought it would be.
18:17 < zackoid> _You finish putting on the +1 pair of boots of the Monkey {*Slow Str+8}.
18:17 < zackoid> i don't know what i'm going to do with that
18:17 < apoch> take it slowly
18:18 < odiv> Yeah, this is looking like a hydrocele.
18:18 < odiv> Time to go back to the clinic tomorrow I guess.
18:19 < odiv> good name for boots anyway
18:19 < zackoid> i guess it means i should wear heavier armour but
18:21 < zackoid> maybe worth it in combination with T - the +3 leather armour of the Lost Path (worn) {rF+ MR+ rCorr Str-3}.
18:21 < zackoid> ?

18:42 < zackoid> hmm, do i want bolt of fire in addition to of cold?
18:50 < valrus> wow, A+ team name y'all
18:51 < zackoid> TIL, death knights can cast torment
18:51 < zackoid> well, agony
19:13 < johnstein> ??agony
19:13 < OCTOTROG> agony[1/1]: Agony does to one living creature what Torment does to all living creatures in sight: halves its hit points, but never directly kills it. Unlike torment, however, agony does a magic resistance check and won't work on those with any negative energy resistance. Is more likely to work than other hexes at the same spellpower.
19:14 < johnstein> oh neat
19:48 < advil> looks like we held on to 19
19:48 < advil> sorry I couldn't do more

10:04 < odiv> Nah, I don't know when I've had it, honestly.
10:04 < odiv> when I get it that early I think I've had like 2 sources of wizardry or something and gone "fuck it"
10:04 < odiv> also, brilliance is sometimes all over the place.
10:05 < zackoid> i think it was at like 50% with wizardry
10:05 < zackoid> 55 or something
10:05 < zackoid> is it like 20/20 conj/fire for vehumet without wizardry?  or more?

12:47 < zackoid> i voted for the other mostly because regen makes the game less annoying to play
12:47 < kimtrucks> ^dump kimtruck
12:47 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
12:47 < kimtrucks> my inv is absurd
12:48 < advil> that's a good ring
12:48 < advil> you don't need to train M&F right now
12:49 < advil> mindelay for a flail is 14
12:49 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L14 MiBe) killed Rupert. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
12:50 < advil> not entirely obvious but the best use of acquirement is often wands, trying for haste or heal wounds...so given your collection of other stuff I might use that scroll for that
12:50 < advil> esp. since trog will give you fancy weapons if you wait
12:50 < zackoid> yeah i was gonna say or a weapon, but trog
12:50 < kimtrucks> my current fancy weapon is  Trog gift
12:51 < advil> oh you already found pearl dragon scales?
12:51 < advil> that may ultimately be better than either of those plates
12:52 < kimtrucks> yeah, I dumped them somewhere safe-ish
12:53 < kimtrucks> but PDS aren’t that useful right now?
12:53 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L14 MiBe) killed Erolcha. (D:13) [cbro+]
12:53 < advil> well I'm not sure, it depends on the details...but they are one of the best endgame armours when enchanted up
12:54 < advil> using either of the plate armours right now isn't wrong
12:54 < advil> careful with erolcha, she can banish
12:55 < advil> not always, but it's hard to predict
13:03 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L14 MiBe) killed Frances. (D:13) [cbro+]
13:19 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L15 MiBe) reached level 15 of the Dungeon. (D:15) [cbro+]
13:23 < kimtrucks> yeah, I think Elrocha has banished me once and Sonja banished me once
13:24 < kimtrucks> Sonja is how I learned a painful lesson about banishing
13:24 < kimtrucks> I escaped after Elrocha’s banishment
13:24 < kimtrucks> (well… escaped the abyss.)
13:33 < zackoid> have you gotten any other weapons?  you're getting to the point where MR- is a problem, even with trog's hand
13:36 < kimtrucks> yeah when I statrt playing again, I’ll revisit
17:41 <@slitherrr> we just barely made it to 19
17:42 <@slitherrr> great job thenoid, as usual, but also kudos to the rest for solid victories
17:44 <@slitherrr> feeling pretty good about my hasu that was also a combo high score somehow (?!?), but kicking myself for that hofi that i managed to splat in holy pan
17:47 < zackoid> you had some pretty shit luck that tourney slitherrr
17:47 <@slitherrr> well, the one time i definitely did
17:47 <@slitherrr> maybe that hofi of beogh could count as bad luck too
17:47 <@slitherrr> but the other slime death and the holy pan death were 100% my fault
17:47 < zackoid> the 6 runes before depths was really impressive though, don't know if you've done that before
17:48 <@slitherrr> i have
17:48 < zackoid> i rescind my awe.

18:04 < zackoid> does parrow have worse accuracy than bolt spells?
18:05 <@slitherrr> ??troll
18:05 < OCTOTROG> troll[1/3]: Abysmally stupid, constantly hungry, and incredibly strong, this player race is best suited to melee combat. Learns Unarmed Combat at the fastest rate out of all skills a troll can learn, and is well suited to it thanks to having a +6 bonus to unarmed combat base damage.
18:05 <@slitherrr> poison arrow? i don't think so?
18:05 <@slitherrr> ??poison arrow
18:05 < OCTOTROG> poison arrow[1/1]: Level 6, range 7 conj/poison spell (Annihilations exclusive), deals 70% resistable damage and poisons poison-resistant natural creatures; the undead cannot be poisoned but still take some damage. 4d53.75 damage at max power (but good luck getting 200 power). To-hit: 5+power/10.
18:05 <@slitherrr> ??LCS
18:05 < OCTOTROG> lehudib's crystal spear[1/1]: AKA: Crystal spear or the acronym LCS. Level 8 Conjurations/Earth spell, found only in Book of Annihilations, randart Sif gifts, and Vehumet offerings. 10d22.3 at max power, theoretically, and unresistable. The strongest single target conjuration, but its range is one square less than that of Iron Shot. To-hit: 10+power/15.
18:05 <@slitherrr> maybe it does
18:06 < zackoid> to-hit means nothing to me as a number
18:06 <@slitherrr> ??fire bolt
18:06 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled fire_bolt in my learndb.
18:06 < zackoid> ??spell power[2
18:06 < OCTOTROG> spell power[2/5]: ...and the significance of this? It's related to conjuration damage and self-enchantment duration, and controls the probability of a resistable spell succeeding in a less-simple fashion. And other appropriate things.
18:06 < zackoid> ??spell power[3
18:06 < OCTOTROG> spell power[3/5]: Note that the power of some spells is capped, most notably conjurations. This is indicated by having a short bar on the second I screen. (the # represent power, btw)
18:06 < zackoid> ??spell power[4
18:06 < OCTOTROG> spell power[4/5]: Got bars (#)? You have at least 0, 10, 15, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200.
18:06 <@slitherrr> ...is it not called fire bolt?
18:06 <@slitherrr> ??bolt of fire
18:06 < zackoid> bolt of fire
18:06 < OCTOTROG> bolt of fire[1/1]: A level 6 conj/fire penetrating beam attack that can hit multiple opponents in a line for pure fire damage. Does six dice with a maximum of (18 + (power * 2) / 3). At power 50 it does 6d8 damage; at power 100 it does 6d14. As with any fire-based beams, produces steam if it passes over water. To-hit: 10+power/25.
18:06 < zackoid> maybe i just don't notice it as much with bolt spells because it usually hits something
18:06 <@slitherrr> well, the number is definitely different from bolt of fire
18:07 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L2 DEFE) fell down a shaft to D:2. (D:1) [cbro+]
18:07 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L2 DEFE) killed Ijyb. (D:2) [cbro+]
18:07 <@slitherrr> and since higher power is better and eveyrthing in that expression is additive, we can assume higher to hit is better and therefore 5 being less than 10 makes poison arrow less accurate
18:07 < advil> I thought poison arrow is better for some reason
18:07 < zackoid> i have 12.5 to-hit with parrow and 13 with bolt of cold
18:08 < zackoid> minimum
18:08 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L3 TrEE) became a worshipper of Qazlal. (D:2) [cbro+]
18:09 < zackoid> parrow is more accurate if i'm at the top end of that power range

18:41 < zackoid> ??jewelry acquirement
18:41 < OCTOTROG> jewellery acquirement[1/2]: Grabs a jewellery base type; this has a 1 in [ring slots+1] chance of being an amulet, and is a ring otherwise. If you've already identified that base type it will try again. It will continue this until it hits a type you have not yet identified or until it has tried 10 times.
18:41 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L12 TrEE) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:11) [cbro+]
18:41 < zackoid> ??jewelry acquirement[2
18:41 < OCTOTROG> jewellery acquirement[2/2]: Rings of hunger/noise and amulets of inaccuracy have a 92.09% chance of being randarts. Other jewellery has a 28.85% chance of being a randart. This is independent from the base type calculation, otherwise.
18:42 <@slitherrr> zackoid, you play uskayaw yet?
18:45 < zackoid> yeah, twice
18:45 < zackoid> or rather, won twice
18:46 < zackoid> ??bai suzhen
18:46 < OCTOTROG> bai suzhen[1/3]: New (0.19) draconian unique for lategame: mid-point of Lair branches, Elf:$, Vaults, Crypt, Depths. Starts out casting Summon Hydra. At half health, turns into a dragon (drops weapon, and tramples), is surrounded by thunder clouds and Summon Hydra is replaced with Primal Wave. Lots of health and AC.

18:48 < zackoid> that was a little closer than it needed to be

11:25 < zackoid> apoch: want any skilling advice?
11:25 < apoch> I wouldn't complain.
11:26 < zackoid> i think you want conjurations to be your highest skill
11:26 < kimtrucks> ^dump kimtruck
11:26 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
11:26 < kimtrucks> so
11:26 < apoch> so focus on conj instead of fire, eh?
11:26 < zackoid> so train exclusively that and fire until you get fireball online, or add some spellcasting if you need the empty levels
11:26 < zackoid> you want fire too
11:26 < kimtrucks> I’m thinking of trying Abyss for my “first 3rd run” e
11:27 < kimtrucks> *rune
11:27 < zackoid> but 11 fire / 1 conj is making it too hard
11:27 <@slitherrr> sup kimtrucks 
11:27 < kimtrucks> simply because Vault:5 is sorta painful for melee
11:27 <@slitherrr> a trick for vault:5
11:27 < zackoid> apoch: also sticky flame is the best spell in that book, definitely learn it and use it a lot.  some would say conjure flame is the best but i'm really bad at using that
11:27 <@slitherrr> go downstairs and read a ?tele
11:27 <@slitherrr> it means you're not leaving for a while, so square up for that
11:27 <@slitherrr> but it's more certain than an abyss run
11:28 <@slitherrr> and you're not just bashing at like a million enemies at once
11:28 < apoch> I stair dance as long as possible at v5
11:28 < apoch> will do zackoid, thanks for the tips
11:28 <@slitherrr> i haven't done anything but ?tele for a long time, it's just too easy to get caught out when stairdancing
11:28 < kimtrucks> yeah last time I died in V5 it was because the stairs got locked by a Warden at the end of my view range
11:29 < apoch> Well, I'm hardly very good at this game, so any advice I offer should be taken with a salt shaker
11:29 < zackoid> apoch: in general the only way i learned how to skill and select spells for blasters was to copy other peoples logs. !!lg odiv DEFE -log or !!hs @mfc or whatever.  
11:30 < zackoid> i would recommend magic mapping before tele maybe.  i stairdance until a warden shows up then tele when i have defenses as good as kim's
11:31 <@slitherrr> abyss would be fun  to go for, but it's probably harder than vaults
11:31 < zackoid> kimtrucks: that demon whip is amazing you should use that most of the time
11:31 < kimtrucks> my one argument for my morningstar is +7 protection isn’t nothing to sneeze at
11:31 < zackoid> oh, i sneeze.
11:32 < advil> oh yeah that is the best demon whip ever pretty much
11:32 < advil> I have never seen anything like it
11:32 < kimtrucks> I guess I tend to overprioritize defense
11:33 < zackoid> it makes sense for newer players to prioritize defense because the main skill of crawl is recognizing threats.  
11:33 < advil> you already have that dwhip at mindelay and it will kill things so fast you don't need defense
11:33 < zackoid> but you have good defenses without protection, and you'll kill things much, much faster with the demon whip
11:33 < kimtrucks> ??demon whip
11:33 < OCTOTROG> demon whip[1/2]: (maces & flails; +1 acc / 11 dam / 1.1 base delay / 0.5 min delay). A terrible weapon, woven in the depths of the inferno. Can be {bless}ed into a {sacred scourge}.
11:33 <@slitherrr> killing things very fast is a kind of defense
11:34 < kimtrucks> if it’s one-handed I might want to go back and pick up that enchanted shield I dropped
11:34 < kimtrucks> to synergize with my SH+3 amulet
11:34 < advil> yeah definitely
11:34 <@slitherrr> it is one-handed
11:34 < zackoid> yeah but you want to use the bow right?
11:34 < kimtrucks> right
11:34 < kimtrucks> I keep on forgetting about taking the shield off
11:34 < zackoid> the bow is 2H
11:34 <@slitherrr> ::shrug:: stop using the bow, easy enough
11:35 < zackoid> i'd rather have a ranged weapon than a buckler of AC
11:35 < kimtrucks> yeah but if I’m going into Vault:5 next, reasonably likely that I won’t have much of a chance to use my bow
11:35 <@slitherrr> i'd rather use javelins
11:35 < kimtrucks> ??crypt
11:35 < OCTOTROG> crypt[1/1]: Accessed from the Vaults somewhere on level 2 or 3. Three levels deep. DracoOmega gave it a revamp involving ancient champions, eidolons, lost souls, phantasmal warriors, and revenants, reducing zombie and skeletal warrior fatigue in the process.
11:36 < zackoid> slitherrr: even if you already had 14 bow skill?
11:36 <@slitherrr> sunk cost fallacy
11:36 < kimtrucks> also doing Orc AFTER Vault:4 is sort of a bloodbath
11:36 < kimtrucks> O-Tab-O-Tab-O-Tab
11:36 < advil> a ranged weapon is good in vaults 5 because you don't really want to walk away from the stairs
11:37 < zackoid> nah, it's only partially sunk cost.  we're talking about relative value and what would work now
11:37 <@slitherrr> well you do, except you don't walk, you teleport
11:37 < advil> well sunk cost fallacy but she hasn't trained throwing
11:37 < advil> javelins suck with 0 throwing now
11:37 <@slitherrr> get 4 in it
11:37 <@slitherrr> that's like two titans or whatever
11:37 < advil> for javelins you kind of want throwing in the teens now
11:37  * kimtrucks looks fondly at my 1.3k arrows
11:38 <@slitherrr> i mean, if you are using nothing but javelins, sure
11:38 <@slitherrr> you can keep the arrows because maybe you'll find an amazing great mace
11:38 < kimtrucks> Trog does love me, but since I’m a “use and abuse Trog’s Hand” kinda girl he doesn’t love me very much. Never become his champion this run
11:39 <@slitherrr> but it's not worth all this hassle just to keep using a shortbow of velocity
11:39 <@slitherrr> shield up and pound shit to death
11:39 < kimtrucks> my shield wasn’t that good, IIRC. 
11:39 < kimtrucks> +1 prot. Might be a better shield somewhere else, I’d have to ctrl+f
11:40 <@slitherrr> it still gives SH and still synergizes with your amulet
11:40 < zackoid> i think it was a buckler of protection, which is a really good buckler but still a buckler
11:41 < advil> I might stick with bows tbh :)
11:41 < advil> 14 is enough to start using a longbow
11:43 < kimtrucks> I think I’m doing more damage with this pretty good shortbow than the less-good longbows of flaming/freezing I’ve found
11:43 <@slitherrr> the great thing about it being a buckler is the cost of switching is low
11:45 <@slitherrr> !apt mi
11:45 < OCTOTROG> Mi: Fighting: 2, Short: 1, Long: 2!, Axes: 2, Maces: 2, Polearms: 2, Staves: 2!, Slings: 1, Bows: 1, Xbows: 1, Throw: 0, Armour: 2!, Dodge: 1, Stealth: -1, Shields: 2!, UC: 1!, Splcast: -4, Conj: -3*, Hexes: -4*, Charms: -4*, Summ: -3*, Nec: -3*, Tloc: -3*, Tmut: -2, Fire: -3*, Ice: -3*, Air: -3, Earth: -2, Poison: -3*, Inv: 0, Evo: -1, Exp: -1, HP: 1, MP: -1*
11:46 <@slitherrr> heh, that short:1 there seems more like a tutorial than anything that actually needs to be there
11:46 <@slitherrr> "don't use short blades on a minotaur", says a deep booming voice
11:53 < kimtrucks> slitherrr isn’t the cost of switching still the 5-turn wait, just like all other armor?
11:54 <@slitherrr> no i mean
11:54 <@slitherrr> getting 4.6 shield skill is easy
11:54 <@slitherrr> so you don't have penalties from the buckler
11:54 <@slitherrr> not switching to bow
11:54 <@slitherrr> and back
11:55 < kimtrucks> fair enough
11:55 < kimtrucks> I’m just a little worried about getting screwed if I need to kite
11:55 < kimtrucks> although I guess I’m not wearing my +blink armor anymore so kiting is less reliable
11:57 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L24 MiBe) entered the Crypt. (Vaults:2) [cbro+]
12:00 < zackoid> kimtrucks: be sure to examine the new monsters in there
12:01 < kimtrucks> yeah I’ve backed out already
12:01 < kimtrucks> first 5 rooms was fine, and then the 40%-in-one-hit began
12:01 < zackoid> i usually do crypt before v:5 but there are some nasty things that you won't have seen before
12:01 < zackoid> was it a curse skull?
12:01 < advil> or flayed ghost
12:01 < kimtrucks> believe so
12:01 < kimtrucks> no I’ve seen flayed ghosts before
12:01 < kimtrucks> also a pain
12:02 < zackoid> welcome to torment!
12:02 < zackoid> ??torment
12:02 < OCTOTROG> torment[1/3]: Effectively halves the current hit points of all living creatures in sight of the caster. Most undead have {torment immunity} (player vampires might not have it). Demonspawns might get {torment resistance} as a mutation when levelling up.
12:02 < advil> ah so then the 40% in one hit was torment (I guess now called hellfire)
12:02 < advil> er not hellfire
12:02 < advil> did they drop that name change?
12:02 < zackoid> hellfire->damnation
12:02 < advil> ahh
12:02 < zackoid> torment is still torment
12:02 < advil> I'm getting mixed up
12:03 < zackoid> kimtrucks: (pretty much all the areas of the extended game are riddled with tormentors, but in a 3-5 rune game you usually only see it through curse skulls in crypt and the occassional abyss monster)
12:04 < zackoid> rN+ reduces the damage from it so you are well equipped for crypt relatively
12:05 < zackoid> ??torment[2
12:05 < OCTOTROG> torment[2/3]: A overrated threat for extended. Do not fear: aside from {torment resistance} and {torment immunity}, one can use tactics outlined in https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=3443&#p43566 to deal with it.
12:05 < zackoid> ??torment[3
12:05 < OCTOTROG> torment[3/3]: Negative energy resistance reduces the damage percentage by 5% per level, so at rNeg+++ torment only takes 35% of your health.
12:05 < zackoid> "only".
12:06 < kimtrucks> yeah I have rN++ right now
12:06 < zackoid> that is really good for that point in the game
12:06 < zackoid> curse skulls are fairly rare even in crypt, if you see more than 2 you're unlucky
12:07 < kimtrucks> I am unlucky
12:35 < advil> most likely is in zot from curse toes
12:35 < advil> you usually see 1-2 of those in any 3 rune game ime
12:46 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L24 MiBe) killed Mara. (Crypt:2) [cbro+]
12:53 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L24 MiBe) reached level 3 of the Crypt. (Crypt:3) [cbro+]
12:54 < kimtrucks> any other branches worth investigating before I do Vaults? Currently on Crypts 3, which is… hazardous and teaching me to love the Stair Dance
12:55 < advil> ^dump kimtruck
12:55 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
12:55 < zackoid> there is elf, but i think for someone who is not used to elf it's probably a toss-up on which is more dangerous between that and V:5
12:55 < kimtrucks> that last battle with both a cursed skull and a flayed ghost was veeeeeery dangerous
12:56 < advil> elf 1-2 should be fine
12:56 < kimtrucks> vanquished creatures
12:56 < kimtrucks> […]   2 curse skulls
12:56 < zackoid> don't really need the XP.  don't do either of those with rF- on though
12:57 < advil> oh I missed the rF-
12:57 < apoch> Is elf back up to 2 now?
12:57 < advil> yeah I wouldn't routinely wear that ring
12:57 < advil> it
12:57 < advil> s three levels
12:57 < kimtrucks> not poor Wosaifuck, my favourite ring that is also how one might transcribe someone saying “Who say ‘fuck’?” 
12:57 < apoch> I thought in .19 it was one.
12:58 < zackoid> in .20 elf will be -1 levels.
12:58 < zackoid> [joke]
12:58 < advil> do you have any rings of protection from cold or fire somewhere in the dungeon?
12:58 < advil> if so I'd carry them
12:58 < kimtrucks> yeah but I can’t figure out what to drop to make space for them
12:58 < advil> even fire/ice
12:58 < advil> drop the slow ring
12:59 < apoch> Elf has been removed and now appears as a special vault on d1 95% of the time. There are no walls. Monster levels have not been changed.
12:59 < advil> and wands of flame
12:59 < zackoid> kimtrucks: drop the *slow ring, wands of slowing and flame and lightning
12:59 < zackoid> don't need to carry cure mutation, enchant weapon and so much food everywhere
13:00 < zackoid> can drop 1 or 2 of the haste wands in the same spot
13:00 < zackoid> i usually leave extra things by the door to vaults
13:01 < advil> I'd probably drop slowing / paralysis, pizzas/jerkies, pot of invis
13:01 < zackoid> pots of flight i also don't carry with me anymore
13:02 < advil> I do in case of certain dire emergencies but it's pretty niche
13:02 < advil> (like, in case you get banished and there's some abyss terrain that you desperately need to fly over.  Also some depth vaults, but you've cleared depths.)
13:05 < advil> man that dwhip was just on the floor?
13:05 < kimtrucks> think so, yeah
13:06 < advil> also worth carrying around a ring of rcorr if you've seen one
13:08 < advil> ??Dyrovepreva
13:08 < OCTOTROG> crown of dyrovepreva[1/2]: +3 unrandart hat {rElec Int+2 SInv}. A large crown of dull bronze, set with a dazzling array of gemstones.
13:08 < kimtrucks> ??flay
13:08 < OCTOTROG> flayed ghost[1/3]: Flayed ghosts can deal smite-targeted, irresistible, torment-like damage that heals when the ghost is killed or you stay away from it for a while. Flaying won't reduce HP below 25.
13:08 < advil> ??Dyrovepreva[2
13:08 < OCTOTROG> crown of dyrovepreva[2/2]: <Sequell> dorocyprova ~ lorocyproca[1/1]: Congratulations on typing that.
13:08 < zackoid> while we're doing dump analysis, what am i forgetting?
13:08 < zackoid> ^dump zackoid
13:08 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/zackoid/zackoid.txt [cbro]
13:09 < kimtrucks> huh, just picked up
13:09 < kimtrucks> the amulet of Tempters (around neck) {Gourm +Blink rC+ Str+3 Slay+2}
13:09 < kimtrucks> seems worse than the amulet of Zes Unwa {Reflect rN+ Dex+7 SH+3}.
13:12 < advil> those are both pretty good, I might switch
13:12 < advil> because of blink
13:12 < advil> then you really don't need your rF- ring
13:12 < advil> zackoid: out of recharging?
13:13 < zackoid> nah there's probably a few on the ground somewhere
13:14 < advil> any staff of energy?
13:14 < advil> also htf do you have so many penetration javelins?
13:14 < zackoid> yeah there's both a staff of energy and a cboe available
13:14 < zackoid> shoals.
13:14 < zackoid> notice i've never actually used one.
13:15 < advil> I wouldn't go cboe yet but the staff of energy is probably worth carrying
13:15 < zackoid> ??staff of energy
13:15 < OCTOTROG> staff of energy[1/1]: When wielded, removes spell hunger and can be evoked for {channeling}.
13:15 < zackoid> ??channeling
13:15 < OCTOTROG> channeling[1/1]: Converts food into mana. The staff succeeds (evo+11)/40, 50 hunger, 1d3 MP; Wucad Mu (evo+1)/25, 50 hunger, 1/5 div miscast, otherwise 2+d5+evo/3 MP;  Sif power 100-300 hunger, d(2+inv/4) mp. For reference, merely resting will recover 14+maxMP per 600 nutrition, at standard metabolic rates.
13:15 < advil> as much for the hunger at this point as anything
13:15 < advil> cboe is more like when you have extended xp to burn on evoc
13:15 < advil> I wouldn't use it much below 20 evoc
13:15 < zackoid> hunger hasn't been an issue because only fire storm has a real cost
13:16 < zackoid> i should probably train up a weapon but i haven't been able to decide on a type
13:16 < zackoid> i found a bunch of speed weapons early so i never bothered
13:16 < advil> what demon blade was available?
13:16 < zackoid> also i think my spell set is way too direct-damage focused but that might just be .19 not having much else
13:16 < zackoid> it's protection now
13:16 < advil> !!apt de
13:16 < OCTOTROG> DE: Fighting: -2*, Short: 0, Long: -1, Axes: -2, Maces: -3*, Polearms: -3*, Staves: 0, Slings: -2, Bows: 1, Xbows: -1, Throw: 0, Armour: -2, Dodge: 2, Stealth: 3, Shields: -2, UC: -2*, Splcast: 3!, Conj: 1, Hexes: 3, Charms: 4!, Summ: 1, Nec: 2!, Tloc: 1, Tmut: 1, Fire: 1, Ice: 1, Air: 0, Earth: 1, Poison: 1, Inv: 1, Evo: 1, Exp: -1, HP: -2, MP: 2!
13:17 < advil> long blades is probably the one to do
13:17 < zackoid> that's what i was going to do but i ended up just carrying the morningstar for relec
13:17 < zackoid> i should probably work on dmsl or controlled blink or something
13:18 < zackoid> and iron shot or LCS i guess
13:18 < zackoid> ugh
13:18 < zackoid> so many things
13:18 < advil> yeah, all those
13:18 < advil> wouldn't worry about LCS for now
13:18 < advil> maybe dmsl next?
13:18 < zackoid> my only non-elemental damage is OOD which has gotten me in trouble a few times
13:19 < zackoid> yeah i think it's at like 25%
13:19 < zackoid> i don't recall if tornado is in the game
13:19 < advil> it's in your inventory :-P
13:19 < zackoid> oh, that must be recent
13:19 < zackoid> heh.
13:19 < advil> parrow is really not bad as irresistable damage
13:19 < zackoid> i guess i should start dumping at air then
13:19 < advil> yeah I think air next
13:19 < zackoid> yeah parrow kills things but it's really ineffcient
13:19 < zackoid> i was gonna drop it for iron shot but i love having that LOS range
13:20 < advil> is glaciate in the game?
13:20 < zackoid> yeah, it was in vehumet's gift set
13:20 < zackoid> it's at like 70%?  maybe that's with wiz.
13:20 < zackoid> so it's about as expensive as tornado
13:21 < advil> for immediate targets I would say: air magic, weapon, cblink (in that preference ranking)
13:21 < zackoid> i'm 95% sure i've never had clink castable
13:22 < advil> it's worth getting
13:22 < zackoid> it's level 8 these days?
13:22 < advil> for extended then your priorities will be (not exactly sure of the ordering) max defensive skills, evoc, necromutation, ice or earth 
13:23 < zackoid> did you kill lom in that game?
13:23 < advil> hm my zig clearer didn't have cblink
13:23 < advil> yes
13:24 < advil> hmm on that character I did use shatter extensively in extended, especially in hell
13:24 < zackoid> how did you kill lom?
13:25 < zackoid> only time i tried with a blaster tornado + OOD did not work at all.
13:25 < advil> heh not sure
13:25 < advil> it took 40 turns tho
13:25 < advil> I probably had LCS by then
13:27 < advil> also, immediately after that I started training evoc, so I bet it was close to my casting limit
13:28 < advil> btw I dropped LCS for the actual zig clearing which is why I'm not sure it's essential
13:28 < zackoid> any single-target must get rapidly problematic in zigs
13:29 < zackoid> but yeah i was wondering mostly for pan and hell lords.
13:29 < advil> yeah, I still had iron shot which I did need occasionally
13:29 < kimtrucks> 3 curse skulls, ahaha /the count
13:30 < kimtrucks> the ring of Xom's Capriciousness (left hand) {rN+ MR+}.
13:30 < advil> I mostly didn't kill hell lords on that run, because of shatter
13:30 < kimtrucks> I actually have better options
13:30 < kimtrucks> but that’s a great name
14:23 < zackoid> advil: don't know if we talked about it, but i was wondering how the kobe zigcompleter from the tournament did it, and here's the answer: 
14:23 < zackoid> https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/5ec7e9/why_kobolds_are_literally_the_best_and_why_trog/
14:23 < zackoid> sounds like a bug with shadow form to be honest.
14:50 < OCTOTROG> isthmus (L20 HOFi) entered an ice cave. (Snake:4) [cbro+]
14:59 < advil> zackoid: ah that's interesting
14:59 < advil> I was looking at that char
14:59 < advil> they had sniper iirc
14:59 < advil> so that may have helped
15:00 < advil> but the shadow damage should be a lot less than the regular xbow damage?
15:01 < zackoid> i have no idea how mimic damage works.  i know for spells it's based on the type and maybe level, but it's not the same spell at all
15:01 < advil> I do agree that ko casters are fun, I had an iron shot casting koee.  Apparently with cblink that I never used?
15:01 < zackoid> i doubt sniper helped much in zigs
15:01 < zackoid> if i'm reading it right, the disc of storms damage was not halved by shadow form?  which is what sound like a bug.  but then i have no idea how they would know that
15:01 < advil> oh
15:01 < zackoid> that seems to suggest that CBL would be really strong in shadow form
15:02 < zackoid> and maybe OOD?
15:02 < advil> wonder how it affects tornado
15:04 < zackoid> ??shadow mimic
15:04 < OCTOTROG> shadow mimic[1/1]: Dithmenos' **** power (passive). Your shadow mimicks your attacks with a frequency depending on piety, 10% chance at **** and 50% at 200 piety. Melee and ranged weapons use an unbranded +0 weapon of your wielded type, and conjurations use "shadow shard" or "shadow bolt", dealing nonelemental damage regardless of your conjuration. Hexes make a second hex attempt. 
15:05 < zackoid> ??sniper
15:05 < OCTOTROG> sniper[1/1]: The +9 heavy crossbow "Sniper" {velocity, SInv}. A +9 vorpal triple crossbow that never misses. Has a base delay of 2.7 and a mindelay of 1.35
15:05 < zackoid> i thought it was more than a triple crossbow
15:06 < zackoid> i wonder if the nevermiss makes up for the horrible delay at max skill
15:06 < zackoid> ??triple crossbow
15:06 < OCTOTROG> triple crossbow[1/3]: Like a crossbow, but three times as good! Base damage 22, base/mindelay 23/10. Historically known as a Chuangzi Nu. Not suitable for shaving.
15:07 < advil> "never misses" is more than a triple crossbow
15:08 < zackoid> i mean in base damage
15:08 < zackoid> that char had a +9 triple xbow of velocity as well.  isn't that strictly better?  with portal projectile?
15:10 < zackoid> ??shadow form
15:10 < OCTOTROG> shadow form[1/4]: Dithmenos' 5* ability - for some skill drain, MP, and piety, you turn invisible for the duration (without glow), gain torment immunity, rRot, rN+++, rPois+++, immunity to hostile enchantments, and 50% damage reduction, but you also deal only 50% attack damage and get two spell anti-enhancer levels.
15:10 < zackoid> ??shadow form[2
15:10 < OCTOTROG> shadow form[2/4]: !lm basil orb dith 1 -tv:<2:>2
15:10 < advil> it's been a while but my memory is that crossbows do miss a lot
15:10 < zackoid> ah so it's because evocations don't care about attack power or spell power
15:11 < advil> interesting...I did always want to try disc of storms in a real zig (as opposed to zigsprint)
15:11 < zackoid> yeah i used it a lot for zigsprint
15:11 < zackoid> remove evocations.

17:32 < OCTOTROG> cloak[1/1]: +1 AC. Comes in poison resistance, magic resistance, invisibility. When you're splashed with acid, the hp damage increases for every equipment slot on which you're not wearing something. A cloak, however, reduces the chance of that happening per slot to 50%.
17:33 < zackoid> ugh, full floor depths vaults

19:13 < OCTOTROG> tomb[1/7]: Accessed from the Crypt on the third level. Three levels deep, with a golden rune at the bottom. A grand place to die, lots of good company, and so very appropriate. Screw not with the sphinxes, for they will SLAY you. Gets a lot easier with practice, due to the low variety.
19:13 < Kimtruck> nooope
19:14 < Kimtruck> gotta get ready to go

20:01 < odiv> I could have had such a low turncount.
20:01 < odiv> my lowest ever and it was 5 runes...
20:01 < odiv> which, you know, says I should probably play faster.
20:01 < zackoid> switching to m&f despite the -3 apt because mennas had a sacred scourge
20:03 < zackoid> this was in a shop on D:1 though: _e - the ring of Cymuj (right hand) {Wiz rF+}
20:03 < zackoid> err U:1
20:04 < zackoid> this is the part of the game i hate, when its time to do the 3rd rune
20:04 < odiv> yeah, no easy options
20:05 < odiv> unless you have statue form or something.
20:05 < zackoid> more just so much inventory / armour / skill / spell reogranizing that needs to be done because the game changes so much at this point
20:06 < odiv> well even then, tomb isn't easy

20:41 < johnstein> ???sticky_flame
20:41 < OCTOTROG> A level 4 fire/conjurations spell. Causes constant fire damage (2d4 - 1 per turn) to an adjacent target. When your character is covered in sticky flame, it shows as "Fire" on your HUD.  / Hitting something with sticky flame again when it's still burning does trivial damage and restarts the duration. Mottled dragons, shadows, shadow wraiths, smoke demons, and other insubstantial
20:41 < OCTOTROG> monsters aren't absorbent enough for sticky flame to take hold. / Hitting an invisible enemy with sticky flame will make it visible. / Note that stepping into water will extinguish the "Fire" effect. This applies to enemies, too. Flying does not prevent dipping into the water. Try using a phial of floods to make water! / Sheep have a 50% chance to spread sticky flame to other
20:41 < OCTOTROG> sheep with duration dur/2 + 1d(dur). Xom finds this hilarious. / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-QMFn1joMU

20:42 < advil> are you trying to make room for tornado?
20:42 < zackoid> sinv yeah
20:43 < zackoid> tornado's at 47% with wiz, so not yet
20:43 < zackoid> i'm thinking fcloud will go for that
20:43 < zackoid> mostly thinking i might need iron shot
20:43 < advil> are you using fireball any more?
20:43 < zackoid> yeah for packs, though i'd scrap it if it weren't for delayed fireball (which i've never actually fired)
20:44 < zackoid> also wondering about servitor
20:45 < advil> you don't seem to cast battlesphere any more
20:45 < zackoid> i could get rid of dispel undead if i had iron shot
20:45 < advil> servitor is very good but you'd want to trim down your spells for it anyways

20:47 < advil> yeah I think I used it in vaults 5
20:47 < advil> which is a bad idea btw
20:48 < zackoid> i think you mean fun idea
20:48 < advil> it does kill stuff dead
20:49 < zackoid> looking through your log reminded me of how many mutators are in pan and how i don't want to play that shit
20:49 < advil> heh
20:49 < zackoid> oh and
20:49 < zackoid> Search for what [? for help]? cure mutation
20:49 < zackoid> _Can't find anything matching that.
20:50 < advil> it's not so bad, firestorm = rmut
20:50 < advil> actually I was mostly using iron shot, lcs, and bolt of fire
20:50 < advil> the latter because of full range
20:50 < advil> any of those will one-shot most mutators
20:50 < zackoid> they say that, but my last 15 runer i had 27 throwing and portal projectile and did everything i could to prioritize mutators and keep other enemies between us and i still ended up with 16 mutations or something just in pan
20:51 < zackoid> guess i'll start with killing battlesphere
20:52 < zackoid> oh also i switched to m&f for a sacred scourge
20:52 < advil> yeah I saw
20:52 < advil> do you have butterflies?

20:56 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L26 DEFE) entered the Pits of Slime. (Lair:6) [cbro+]

21:03 < zackoid> if you dig 2-wide corridors in slime, are they still burny?
21:03 < zackoid> or 3-wide
21:07 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L26 DEFE) reached level 5 of the Pits of Slime. (Slime:5) [cbro+]
21:07 < advil> 3-wide is ok I guess?  not sure why you'd bother
21:07 < zackoid> only 1 down stair on slime:4
21:07 < zackoid> but 3 does leave a clear lane.  but failed to find a connection
21:12 < zackoid> hmm, i guess i should draw TRJ out?
21:12 < advil> probably easier that way
21:12 < apoch> Draw TRJ like one of your french girls
21:13 < OCTOTROG> zackoid (L26 DEFE) killed the Royal Jelly. (Slime:5) [cbro+]
21:13 < zackoid> that was pretty easy, heh

21:34 < zackoid> argh, my only 2 acquirements both gave me plate.

22:15 < zackoid>  r - a cursed ring of resist corrosion (right branch)

22:15 < zackoid> heh
22:18 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L3 DEFE) killed Terence. (D:2) [cbro+]
22:19 < apoch> I found a staff of air.. but I"m a DEFE
22:19 < zackoid> i would just use that whip
22:19 < zackoid> the air staff gives you relec in a pinch
22:19 < zackoid> otherwise pretty useless for a long time
22:20 < zackoid> you wand a staff of power, conj, energy or fire probably in that order
22:22 < zackoid> i can't believe you got out of that with no damage
22:25 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L6 DEFE) became a worshipper of Vehumet. (D:4) [cbro+]
22:26 < zackoid> use sticky flame
22:26 < zackoid> if you know where he is
22:27 < zackoid> it does a ton of damage both up front and over time, and is extremely mana efficient for it's level
22:27 < zackoid> with the bonus of making invis things vi
22:27 < zackoid> vis.
22:27 < apoch> Yeah, I try to stick to the lower hunger level spells when I can
22:27 < OCTOTROG> meatyocre (L8 MiBe) killed the ghost of apoch the Arsonist, a novice DEFE. (D:6) [cbro+]
22:28 < zackoid> hunger isn't a big deal, though if it's ##### i'd try not to cast it all the time
22:28 < zackoid> but i was mostly talking about the invis guy
22:28 < zackoid> you should definitely use it on things like ogres and then kite them though
22:28 < zackoid> 2 unlucky EV rolls and boom
22:29 < zackoid> sting is really good for pulling because it has max range and applies poison
22:29 < zackoid> which you probably know but i'm just throwing things out as i think of them
22:29 < apoch> I'm just happy to have something that works against crimson imps
22:29 < zackoid> let me know if you don't want my advice
22:29 < zackoid> heh, do you know about imp parking?
22:30 < zackoid> little fuckers are so annoying
22:30 < apoch> Yeah, had to do it last game
22:30 < apoch> Despite how much enjoyment I get out of seeing your consternation when I fight Sigmund on D2, I do appreciate the advice
22:30 < zackoid> used to be immune to poison too iirc
22:31 < zackoid> well i realize that i give advice without people asking and maybe not everyone appreciates that so i've been trying to ask
22:32 < zackoid> heh never go back down that other stairs
22:32 < apoch> right?!
22:32 < zackoid> conjure flame would be good here
22:32 < zackoid> it might block him
22:32 < zackoid> or he'll walk through it and take damage
22:32 < zackoid> need to back up out of polearm reach
22:34 < apoch> do I want freeze?
22:35 < zackoid> eh, it's good but sticky flame fills the same role.  only use would be against rF things?
22:35 < zackoid> i'd just wait for the next gift
22:35 < zackoid> gonna go to bed in a minute, what's your training look like?
22:36 < zackoid> what's fireball at?
22:36 < zackoid> i'd get fireball into the grey territory then add in fighting, dodging and spellcasting a bit
22:36 < zackoid> spellcasting only if you need more levels to learn stuff
22:36 < apoch> thanks
22:36 < zackoid> as your piety goes up those fail rates will come down a lot too
22:37 < zackoid> biggest thing to remember is just that out of mana is usually death, so try to keep adds down and treat being out of mana as an emergency
22:38 < zackoid> gl
22:38 < zackoid> oh and fireball is really loud
22:38 < zackoid> so leave after you use it
22:39 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L8 DEFE) entered a bailey. (D:7) [cbro+]

22:40 < apoch> Oh damn it
22:40 < apoch> oh well
22:41 < zackoid> dangit i picked the wrong time to brush my teeth
22:41 < zackoid> curse you dentistry!
22:41 < apoch> I would have been too busy screwing up to pay attention
22:43 < zackoid> if you want to get farther, in your next game play by a strict conduct that once a monster notices you, you're not allowed to take any action until you take 10 steps back.  5 steps back if it's faster than you.
22:43 < zackoid> offensive action, that is
22:43 < zackoid> that'll help internalize noise and reducing packs
22:43 < zackoid> it's extremely tedious but that's how the people that get 30 game streaks actually play
22:48 < apoch> that sound boooring
22:48 < apoch> I should probalby learn to play that way

00:46 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L27 TrEE) found a slimy rune of Zot. (Slime:5) [cbro+]
00:48 <@slitherrr> 4 scrolls of acquirement down there
00:51 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L27 TrEE) entered the Crypt. (Vaults:3) [cbro+]
00:54 <@slitherrr> so hilariously, necromancers as enemies are least scary in the crypt :/
00:57 < OCTOTROG> slitherrr (L27 TrEE) reached level 3 of the Crypt. (Crypt:3) [cbro+]
01:00 <@slitherrr> i have two paths that are mutually exclusive
01:00 <@slitherrr>  I - the +9 storm dragon scales "Qitok" {rElec rPois Regen+ Dex+2 Slay+2}
01:00 <@slitherrr> Q - the +4 moon troll leather armour (worn) {Spirit, Regen++ MP+5}.
01:00 <@slitherrr> the latter gives me nearly castable statue form
01:01 <@slitherrr> which will give me poison immunity, a slaying bonus and an AC bonus
01:01 <@slitherrr> the former gives me flat AC, rpois, and the slaying bonus (and relec but i have that on a ring)
01:01 <@slitherrr> hilarious!
01:03 < odiv> hm
01:04 < odiv> what does statue form get rid of?
01:04 < odiv> body armour, also hat?
01:04 < odiv> ???statue form
01:04 < OCTOTROG> Grants 17 + pow/10 AC, +30% HP, +2 Str, -2 Dex. Makes the base cost of an action 15 instead of 10, like the slow spell. Melds gloves, boots, bardings, and body armour. Provides rElec, rN+, 50% rTorm, rRot+, and poison immunity. 3 + str/3 bonus UC damage and 50% bonus on all melee. Gargoyles can't cast this spell. / Gives plate armour GDR, halves damage from torment and gives rotting
01:04 < OCTOTROG> resistance. Prior to 0.16, gargoyles get 4 less AC than other races in statue form (and still lose all of their innate AC)! In 0.16 and later, gargoyles can't cast it at all. Makes you take extra damage from shatter, but you knew that already.
01:04 < odiv> oh, not hat
01:04 < odiv> and you're not wearing boots or gloves anyway.
01:04 < odiv> so you lose your regen and spirit if it matters.
01:05 < odiv> oh wait, does that drain your MP when you come out of statue form?

02:28 < OCTOTROG> strength[1/2]: Strength reduces penalties from wearing body armour; see {aevp}. Has a small impact on melee and launcher damage, roughly +25% of initial damage per 10 points of str above 10.

02:28 < OCTOTROG> dex[1/1]: Increases accuracy by dex/2, chance of stabbing distracted mons and stealth as well. Plays a significant role in EV if you have {dodging} skill. Boosts ability to shield-block, especially for bucklers, less for large shields.

09:30 < kimtrucks> ??Zot
09:30 < OCTOTROG> zot[1/6]: The final area of the game, although not necessarily the very last realm any player ever goes to. Filled with draconians, dragons, and all sorts of nasty types out to obliterate you. Found on Depths:5, and you can only unlock it with with 3 or more runes (found in dungeon branches). Five levels deep.
09:30 < kimtrucks> ??Zot[2
09:30 < OCTOTROG> zot[2/6]: Mind the gaps in your resistances while you are down here, especially fire and electricity- electric golems and orbs of fire in particular are infamously strong. Use potions of resistance, seriously.

09:31 < OCTOTROG> THE WIZARD'S CASTLE[1/5]: MANY CYCLES AGO, IN THE KINGDOM OF N'DIC, THE GNOMIC WIZARD ZOT FORGED HIS GREAT *ORB OF POWER*. HE SOON VANISHED, LEAVING BEHIND HIS VAST SUBTERRANEAN CASTLE FILLED WITH ESURIENT MONSTERS, FABULOUS TREASURES, AND THE INCREDIBLE *ORB OF ZOT*.
09:31 < kimtrucks> Things have gotten weird in exposition-bot land
09:31 < apoch> Thins are always weird in exposition land
09:32 < johnstein> ?!crawl-cube
09:32 < OCTOTROG> {CRAWL-CUBE}: In a single rotation of the Dungeon sphere, each Crawl corner point rortates through the other 3-corner Crawl points, thus creating 16 floors, 96 hours and 4-simultaneous 27-hour days within a single rotation of Dungeon - equated to a Higher Order of Life Crawl Cube.
09:32 < advil> ??esurient
09:32 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled esurient in my learndb.

09:37 < kimtrucks> ??death cob
09:37 < OCTOTROG> death cob[1/7]: A dreadful undead cob of maize.  No longer a joke in 0.17+! Now they are super hungry ghosts who can take you from full to starving in a single round. Beware if you have low EV!
09:37 < kimtrucks> oh
09:37 < kimtrucks> I’ve hit 27
09:38 < kimtrucks> STR 26, Int 7, Dex 16
09:38 < kimtrucks> can’t figure out what to increase now that I know this is it
09:38 < advil> dex
09:38 < advil> that death cob entry is old, now they slow you
09:44 < kimtrucks> ??lindwurm
09:44 < OCTOTROG> lindwurm[1/2]: Nasty little wurm that breathes fire for 3d18 damage. Avoid if you can (and don't have fire resistance).
09:49 < zackoid> kimtrucks: every level of zot is as dangerous as anything else you've faced, and zot:5 is worse still, fyi
09:49 < zackoid> when you get to zot:5 probably stop and ask questions and maybe have someone guide you through it later.
09:50 < zackoid> and even single orbs of fire are a huge threat worthy of stopping and thinking as soon as you see one
09:53 < kimtrucks> ??drain
09:53 < OCTOTROG> drain[1/4]: Reduces your skills until you gain more XP (no long-term effect). Press m to see how much your skills got drained. A potion of experience does not end the effect.

10:16 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L1 DEFE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
10:17 < odiv> I don't know if I've ever noticed their special melee.
10:17 < odiv> I remember them doing stuff like drop kicking or something weird.
10:19 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L3 DEFE) killed Terence. (D:2) [cbro+]
10:24 < kimtrucks> since there’s a gigantic room across an ocean and I can’t cblink, all that’s left is Zot:5

10:32 < OCTOTROG> advil (L16 TrHu) found a serpentine rune of Zot. (Snake:4) [cbro+]
10:32 < zackoid> advil: oh and yeah having a full inventory is horrible, it's why i wasn't sad when my early-jiyva troll died
10:33 < advil> I have surprisingly ok stuff all things told
10:33 < kimtrucks> ok, NOW all I have left is Zot:5
10:33 < kimtrucks> unless I feel like taking a tour of Tomb (no, not really) or Abyss (ditto) or Hell (nope)
10:35 < zackoid> go down to zot:5 and read a scroll of magic mapping and then don't do anything else
10:35 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L27 MiBe) reached level 5 of the Realm of Zot. (Zot:5) [cbro+]
10:35 < odiv> ooh, nice dwhip
10:36 < kimtrucks> feels like Orb is due north
10:36 < advil> indeed
10:36 < zackoid> half or more of the map is for ellipses, the orb is in the middle of the square chamber at the top of those.
10:36 < odiv> can you bring up map?
10:36 < kimtrucks> lotta big empty rooms up in here
10:36 < zackoid> those lobes are the most dangerous part of a normal game
10:36 < advil> you basically want to clear the rest of the floor before going near the north area
10:36 < odiv> oh, I guess you guys see a minimap, eh?
10:36 < OCTOTROG> sleevener (L13 FeHe) killed Maurice. (D:13) [cbro+]
10:36 < zackoid> becuase they're wide open and full of liches and orbs of fire and orb guardians
10:36 < kimtrucks> yeah
10:36 < kimtrucks> ok
10:37 < odiv> and if you're unlucky a drac shifter that will put you right in the middle of it.
10:37 < advil> I might even work from a different staircase than that one
10:37 < kimtrucks> after taking the orb does something bad happen, or is it just a SHIFT+G: —> D1 run out the front door?
10:37 < odiv> ^whereis
10:37 < zackoid> both.
10:37 < OCTOTROG> odiv the Destroyer (L16 TeVM), a worshipper of Vehumet, saved on Snake:3 on 2016-11-20 after 35722 turns. [cbro]
10:37 < advil> weird, why is the beem bot in your chat now
10:38 < advil> wonder if it shows up whenever there's enough spectators
10:38 < zackoid> that's how i get out (G->D0) but it starts spawning really nasty enemies just out of your line of sight
10:38 < kimtrucks> and will it keep spawning on every floor, just Zot5, or just all Zot floors?
10:38 < zackoid> actually i usually have a route planned out to get out of zot with a specific set of staircases, but after that i just autotravel as much as i can
10:38 < zackoid> every floor all the time
10:38 < advil> all floors
10:38 < zackoid> so you just keep moving, only heal when you're standing on an upstairs
10:38 < kimtrucks> great
10:39 < kimtrucks> okie dokie then
10:39 < advil> sometimes it's fairly innocuous, sometimes it can be bad
10:39 < zackoid> but you have to get it first :)
10:39 < kimtrucks> spam Trog’s Hand all day erryday
10:39 < advil> but there's no need to fight anything
10:39 < advil> just run away
10:39 < odiv> Yeah, sometimes two pan lords show up
10:39 < advil> yeah, the lobes are usually harder than the orb run
10:39 < odiv> you want to not zerk and be super careful.
10:39 < odiv> I saw a guy zerk on D:1 to take out something dumb and he almost died.
10:39 < odiv> because he was slow after.
10:39 < kimtrucks> I almost never zerk as-is, that should be easy
10:40 < zackoid> we shouldn't be talking about the orb run yet heh
10:40 < odiv> true true
10:40 < kimtrucks> Zerk is basically my “huh I can’t tele because I’m constricted and I’m surrounded” panic button
10:41 < kimtrucks> I prefer potions, wands, rods, the trog-ally ability, etc. before beserking
10:42 < OCTOTROG> advil (L16 TrHu) entered the Pits of Slime. (Lair:6) [cbro+]

10:43 < odiv> advil: no idea.
10:43 < kimtrucks> not going to try to Zot 5 during a break

10:43 < kimtrucks> apport?
10:43 < kimtrucks> ??aport

10:43 < advil> I do have apport, it's not great but it's going to be a long time before it gets better
10:43 < odiv> for advil.
10:44 < odiv> well artefacts can't get eated

10:45 < apoch> I'm working from home.
10:45 < apoch> I just advised someone to restart their computer because there are too many people working remotely.
10:45 < zackoid> i'm working exactly as much as i normally do.
10:45 < apoch> Which is really dumb advice but I shouldn't have this ticket anyway
10:46 <@shmup> living the life, zackoid 
10:46 < advil> wonder if it's worth burning a haste pot
10:46 <@shmup> lol apoch 
10:47 < zackoid> it's the trade off for bad pay and no status.

10:48 < odiv> Not that my XL16 Tengu is super valuable.
10:48 < advil> well I got nothing out of that
10:48 < odiv> you got a rune!
10:49 < odiv> ...
10:49 < advil> there's no way to paralyze jellies any more that I can find, either
10:49 < kimtrucks> I’m going to unequip my shield and use my +8? +9? shortbow to help me with the lobes
10:49 < kimtrucks> try to snipe monsters out
10:50 < odiv> well that sucks, advil.
10:50 < zackoid> there's no paralyzing jellies anymore?
10:51 < odiv> They probably didn't want Slime:$ to be too easy for Jiyva players I guess.
10:51 < odiv> Like how AK can't find the rune in the starting abyss.
10:51 < zackoid> * Jiyva's jelly paralyse ability has been removed.

10:51 < OCTOTROG> trog[1/9]: God of anger and violence. Expects followers to kill constantly in his name; hates magic and all who practice it.
10:51 < zackoid> i think it was an a ability for awhile
10:51 < advil> I should have jsut waited for apport, all it did was feed the jellies
10:51 < odiv> Yeah, I dont' remember it being very good.

10:52 < advil> and robe of augmentation, which would be good if I didn't already have IDS
10:52 < odiv> when I tried to freeze the jellies when I got to slime:$ I didn't realize it's LOS only.
10:53 < odiv> So that kinda sucked.

10:54 < zackoid> nice ring.
10:55 < zackoid> and shield.
10:55 < zackoid> i wonder if stat shuffling is really annoying now
10:55 < zackoid> mine was down to 11 str because jiyva kept dropping it
10:55 < odiv> at least you don't have to worry about weight, right?
10:56 < advil> stat shuffling was being really annoying in a robe
10:56 < advil> right now it seems mildly skewed towards str
10:56 < advil> ??slimify
10:56 < OCTOTROG> slimify[1/1]: Jiyva ability that coats your melee attack with slime. Hitting a corporeal undead or natural monster will turn it into a neutral slime of similar HD with no resistance checks. Durably summoned/god wrath no longer provides immunity to slimify.

Jiyva will

10:58 < zackoid> wiki says 8-12 which is a LOT for an ability

10:59 < advil> any idea why thorn hunters are not slimifiable?
10:59 < advil> ??shallow water
10:59 < OCTOTROG> shallow water[1/2]: Waist-deep pools of water. Moving through this stuff is gonna be really slow! All but Ogre, Troll, Centaur, Gray draconian, Naga, Merfolk, or Octopode players in shallow water will fumble their attack 4-out-of-DEX times, and 20% of the time regardless as well. Monsters will fumble their attack 1/4 of the time.
10:59 < zackoid> is plant not a subcategory of natural?
10:59 < zackoid> ??natural
10:59 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled natural in my learndb.
10:59 < zackoid> ??holiness
10:59 < OCTOTROG> holiness[1/1]: Every Crawl monster has a holiness stat, from (holy, plant, natural, undead, nonliving, demonic). This stat reflects the monster's general nature, and many effects only occur to some types; polymorph only affects natural creatures and demons, and torment holy/natural, DU undead, etc.  Nonliving monsters are immune to confusion. (not in 0.17+)
11:00 < zackoid> that i guess
11:00 < zackoid> holiness is such a terrible word for that concept.
11:00 < advil> ok, plants are not natural
11:02 < zackoid> they should replace holiness with dominion

13:03 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Conqueror (L27 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by an Orb Guardian on Zot:5, with 704538 points after 86118 turns and 7:31:22. [cbro+]
13:03 < kimtrucks> RIP MiBe of Trog
13:03 < apoch> Damn kim, I'm sorry
13:04 < kimtrucks> hey I got to Zot:5 for first time!
13:04 < kimtrucks> I’m not that upset
13:04 < kimtrucks> I had like a 50% chance of rtele sending me in a beneficial direction
13:04 < apoch> zot is super tricky
13:04 < kimtrucks> it was a good run
13:13 < zackoid> what happened?
13:13 < apoch> She got surrounded and teleported into the orb chamber
13:13 < zackoid> teleported by what?
13:13 < apoch> a scroll of teleport
13:13 < zackoid> ah, poop.
13:14 < apoch> dropped her in about the worst possible spot
13:14 < zackoid> tele is too dangerous on zot:5 but the new blink rules make it kinda hard to escape
13:14 < zackoid> pretty sure my first zot:5 i had someone hold my hand the whole way through
13:14 < zackoid> it's so different than the rest of the game
13:21 < zackoid> there's a thread on the tavern called "what tactical advice revolutionised your play" and it has this zen koan of crawl:
13:22 < zackoid> "So instead of giving you lots of advice and overwhelming you with information, I will provide instead this single, not-as-simple-as-it-sounds piece of information I use to tell apart good players from not-good players: You should almost never move toward an enemy that is in your line-of-sight. Once you understand this you will improve."
13:22 < zackoid> it sounds totally wrong, but internalizing why that is is the turning point for everyone that plays crawl
13:22 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L1 DEFE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
13:23 < advil> :-(
13:31 < advil> actually I noticed kim was already doing that sometimes, which probably explains being so close to winning
13:34 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L5 DEFE) entered a sewer. (D:3) [cbro+]
13:35 < kimtrucks> yeah, my options atthat point were tele + risk of death, not tele + guaranteed death, or blink + probably die

13:50 < advil> maybe this replaced mottled?  the scales are the same

13:51 < zackoid> hopefully that means they make black draconians blue and golden dragons some chromatic or some other color
13:53 < zackoid> but anyway getting a useful resistance on one of the better armours is great!
13:53 < zackoid> finally a light-armour buff!

14:03 < OCTOTROG> advil (L18 TrHu) killed Jory. (Vaults:2) [cbro+]

14:35 <@slitherrr> is cblink completely gone on zot:5, or just post-orb?
14:35 < zackoid> it is gone in all of zot
14:35 < zackoid> so is passage of golubria
14:36 < kimtrucks> yeah that would be what killed me dead

14:36 < kimtrucks> I thought I could blink out with my scrolls
14:36 < kimtrucks> not so!
14:36 <@slitherrr> my typical approach is
14:36 <@slitherrr> edge up to the lungs entrance
14:36 <@slitherrr> see an enemy, catch its attention
14:36 <@slitherrr> bolt backward like an los worhth
14:36 <@slitherrr> deal with the enemy
14:36 <@slitherrr> rinse repeat
14:36 < kimtrucks> I actually got near the top of a lung
14:37 < kimtrucks> but the enemies ran faster than me
14:37 <@slitherrr> yeah orb guardians are fastish
14:37 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L8 DEFE) killed Sigmund. (D:6) [cbro+]

14:40 <@slitherrr> sorry for repeatedly pinging you, kim
14:41 < kimtrucks> no worries
14:41 < kimtrucks> I have an S on my name here

14:41 <@slitherrr> oh that's helpful
14:41 <@slitherrr> electric golem
14:42 <@slitherrr> curse toe!
14:42 < kimtrucks> not as nasty as the curse skull/flayed ghost combo I fought, twice
14:42 <@slitherrr> yeah that's pretty nasty
14:42 <@slitherrr> orb of fire + 2 ancient liches is a "gtfo" combo
14:43 <@slitherrr> i wonder how that orb guardian cot into the corridor there
14:43 < kimtrucks> I can’t remember if this is how I died
14:43 < kimtrucks> yes
14:43 < kimtrucks> it is
14:43 <@slitherrr> figured it was
14:43 < kimtrucks> and once I got tele’d into orb room I just panicked instead of, at least, moving into corner
14:44 <@slitherrr> stepping up-left would have given you a tiny bit more breating room
14:44 < kimtrucks> also which I had this run during tourney for the points
14:44 <@slitherrr> yeah
14:44 <@slitherrr> good run though
14:44 < kimtrucks> half of me wanted to try to fight through the guardians to the orb
14:44 < kimtrucks> half wanted to step into corner
14:44 <@slitherrr> and the odds are not in favor of landing outside the lobes with tele anyway
14:44 <@slitherrr> so no guarantees
14:45 <@slitherrr> sounds like you're ready to win next, though
14:45 <@slitherrr> pretty sure my first win was waaaay after 63 games
14:45 < kimtrucks> no given my current pattern I’ll spend next 10 games getting stomped on D2
14:45 < kimtrucks> then 1 game getting to D12
14:46 < kimtrucks> then 1 game to lair

19:12 < OCTOTROG> mummy[1/8]: When destroyed, all mummies cast a death curse. For normal mummies (i.e. 'a mummy'), this could curse items. For other mummies (e.g. 'guardian mummy'), it will be a random {necromancy miscast} effect. Regular mummies are vulnerable to fire damage. In 0.17 and up, regular mummies have no death curse.

20:49 < zackoid> on the bright side i don't have to do pan and now i don't have to play crawl again for a few months

09:42 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L9 DEFE) killed Pikel. (D:7) [cbro+]
09:54 < zackoid> advil: it would have been a lot better for our team if you had just kept those 8 games to the one account
09:54 < zackoid> apoch: woo!  fuck joseph!
09:54 < apoch> Managed to sticky flame him and run away
09:54 < apoch> then had to do it again
09:55 < zackoid> crazy how many of thse games he's showed up in
09:56 < apoch> Yeah.
09:59 < zackoid> apoch: be careful with that deep troll, it'll probably run right through a conjured flame
09:59 < apoch> good to know
09:59 < apoch> I haven't found any spell books yet
10:00 < zackoid> sticky flame doesn't stick to ghosts, i'd run up stairs
10:00 < zackoid> it still does a little damage when you apply it
10:01 < OCTOTROG> apoch the Thaumaturge (L10 DEFE), worshipper of Vehumet, blasted by an orc priest (divine providence) on D:9, with 7572 points after 15446 turns and 0:56:36. [cbro+]
10:02 < apoch> oh damn
10:02 < zackoid> i shouted noooo when you walked toward the DT :(
10:02 < apoch> Yeah.. should have hit from a distance
10:02 < apoch> that was dumb
10:02 < zackoid> i didn't see what killed it though?
10:03 < apoch> sticky flame
10:03 < zackoid> also go up the stairs when you had the chance even after you pulled it
10:03 < apoch> I figured I'd get punched to death going up the stairs
10:03 < zackoid> if a monster the same speed as you goes up the stairs with you (which it would have once it was adjacent) it doesn't get attacks
10:04 < zackoid> it's only if you leave them behind but they are still close they might get shots in
10:04 < apoch> Ah.. I didn't know that. I assumed they got a free shot anyway
10:04 < zackoid> stairs are weird
10:06 < zackoid> so --FE are really good against things that are dangerous but don't have ranged attacks, like that out-of-depth DT.  if you can get it in LOS, from far away, without attracking its friends then you can usually nuke it down without a scratch
10:06 < zackoid> so you say, fireball it until it's next to you then drop sticky flame
10:06 < zackoid> fireball is really good because it is un-evadable, but it is really loud
10:07 < zackoid> for things that aren't scary you can be more concerened with MP effeciency, but for nasty things just throw everything you've got at 'em
10:09 < advil> there was a deep troll on D9?
10:10 < apoch> Two of them!
10:10 < apoch> also held lair and orc entrances
10:13 < zackoid> also fun for things that are strong enough or stupid enough to walk through conjure flame is to make an entire row of them
10:13 < OCTOTROG> Wesley (L12 DsFi) killed the ghost of kimtruck the Bludgeoner, a journeyman MiBe of Trog. (Lair:3) [cbro+]
10:14 < apoch> I'm just a baby defe. Getting better. After I got fireball down to grey, I started skilling spellcasting to bring down hunger costs and some dodge and stealth
10:15 < OCTOTROG> blobert (L10 GrBe) killed the ghost of apoch the Thaumaturge, a novice DEFE of Vehumet. (D:9) [cbro+]
10:18 < zackoid> that works.  fightining in there somewhere too for HP
10:19 < zackoid> !!hs apoch DEFE
10:19 < OCTOTROG> 32. apoch the Thaumaturge (L10 DEFE of Vehumet), blasted by an orc priest (divine providence) on D:9 (orc_david_3) on 2016-11-24 15:01:54, with 7572 points after 15446 turns and 0:56:36.
10:19 < apoch> it was that last one
10:19 < apoch> definitely the furthest I had gotten
10:19 < zackoid> yeah was just checking htat it was the furthers
10:19 < zackoid> TYPING!
10:39 < OCTOTROG> advil (L19 TrHu) killed Margery. (Vaults:3) [cbro+]
10:41 < zackoid> advil: you have a better shield than that
10:41 < zackoid> ?
10:41 < advil> arguable
10:41 < advil> but it's a randart so it won't get eaten if I leave it there
10:42 < advil> the +2 shield of Xokloff (worn) {+Blink rElec Int-2 Stlth+}
10:42 < zackoid> i guess *corr is worse than normal on a troll too
10:42 < advil> yeah I didn't like the looks of it
10:42 < advil> evocable blink is good too, though I can sort of cast it now
10:42 < zackoid> how does console show monsters that have that simulacra-reaping status?
10:43 < advil> uh I have no idea
10:43 < advil> what even is that
10:43 < advil> also what is a bound soul
10:43 < zackoid> that is bound soul, new spell that necromancers have
10:44 < zackoid> they place it on mobs and some of them generate simulacra when they die
10:44 < advil> heh
10:44 < advil> I had no idea
10:44 < zackoid> in tiles there's a little icon in the corner
10:45 < zackoid> summons in console have the background color flipped or something like that?  or do you have to xv?
10:45 < advil> it says somewhere or other
10:46 < advil> it's blue, maybe that's what that means
10:47 < zackoid> so much mores
10:47 < advil> yeah it's particularly noticeable in vaults
10:47 < advil> every once in a while they find a bunch of loot or something
10:48 < zackoid> i recently stole someone's rc that disables more but puts in a bunch of force_mores for things.  it means i don't end up mashing space when fighting 3 things at once but also there are probably things missing
10:48 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L6 MiBe) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:4) [cbro+]
10:49 < zackoid> started because i took two steps with a mutator in view by accident and got blurry vision a few games ago
10:49 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L6 MiBe) killed Grinder. (D:4) [cbro+]
10:50 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L7 MiBe) killed Eustachio. (D:4) [cbro+]

10:52 < zackoid> was that one hit from the warden?
10:52 < advil> apparently
10:52 < advil> with just -4 corrosion
10:52 < zackoid> he was mighted
10:52 < advil> must have been a terrible roll
10:52 < advil> ah
10:53 < zackoid> i was thinking, until that point, that you were really lucky the weaver wasn't just spamming corrossion
10:53 < zackoid> then wahm
10:53 < zackoid> wham
10:53 < advil> it was targetting jellies I think
10:53 < zackoid> no love for PDA?
10:53 < advil> haha I didn't even see that
10:53 < zackoid> damn art PDA
10:54 < zackoid> i was wondering why you were leaving it to get eaten even if you weren't wearing it
10:54 < advil> hm it's alright
10:54 < zackoid> alright?!
10:55 < advil> :-P
10:55 < advil> ok fine +6 ac, status quo on ev
10:55 < advil> no rC though
10:56 < zackoid> is this trunk?  the ?/15 on wands is nice
10:56 < advil> yeah
10:56 < advil> makes sense given that I think the maxes are fixed
10:57 < advil> this is a 0.19 trunk game upgraded to 0.20
10:57 < zackoid> oh that is why you had the amulet of obsolete.  i was wondering how you updated a save from an old version, but git->git
10:57 < advil> just making sure I didn't miss any other randarts
10:58 < advil> ugh tr apts

11:04 < odiv> oooh
11:04 < odiv> is this jiyva?
11:04 < odiv> I forget.
11:04 < advil> yeah
11:04 < zackoid> yeah.
11:04 < zackoid> so bazaars are good
11:04 < advil> so I have very little cash
11:04 < advil> well good but frustrating
11:04 < zackoid> tru
11:05 < zackoid> if you had left stuff on the portal, would any of it been eaten?  i don't really get how fake time works on level you're not on
11:05 < zackoid> need rF+?
11:06 < advil> I have one ring already
11:06 < zackoid> what is that scroll?
11:07 < advil> summoning or torment
11:07 < advil> I think just consumables
11:10 < advil> I wonder if jiyva rcorr really works
11:10 < advil> or, did rcorr get nerfed?
11:11 < zackoid> i didn't know jiyva had an rcorr mechanic
11:11 < advil> says so on the religion screen at least
11:11 < advil> ??jiyva
11:11 < OCTOTROG> jiyva[1/3]: *: request jelly invocation; **: gain nutrition on slurps; ***: prayer effect that paralyses slimes in LOS for 5 piety, mutation gifts; ****: {slimify}, mp on slurps; *****: cure bad mutation invocation, hp on slurps; ******: possible friendly temporary slime if hit for > 25% maxhp, slime:6 walls removed
11:11 < zackoid> rcorr was nerfed awhile ago
11:12 < advil> and I don't have it from anything else
11:12 < advil> maybe they added that when paralyze went?
11:12 < zackoid> nah it's on the wiki for ages ago

19:43 < johnstein> hm. not sure if symlinking will work. I could probably get the game working (councilgod-PR would be the local branch that automatically tracks the PR, and I could just create symlinked folders pointing to the existing councilgod folders
19:44 < johnstein> oh. that would auto append to the milestones and logfile I think
19:44 < johnstein> which I think means sequell wouldn't notice a difference
19:45 < johnstein> and if it ever got pulled into an official branch, I could just remove the -PR from the setup and use the official branch and still maintain the same folders.

23:36 < isthmus> heh
23:36 < isthmus> did you pick your ancestor's path?
23:36 < odiv> knight
23:36 < odiv> I'm trying long blades, which seemed like a good idea
23:36 < odiv> but now with this ring
23:37 < odiv> ...
23:37 < odiv> and I found a good robe
23:37 < isthmus> LB is definitely good for any mummy
23:37 < isthmus> works well with spellcasting and dodging
23:37 < odiv> got an early great sword
23:38 < isthmus> aim for a demon blade + shield later
23:38 < isthmus> since you're a caster, you will want to pick up mephitic cloud at some point
23:38 < isthmus> how tough is the knight?
23:38 < odiv> seems tough so far
23:38 < isthmus> ^watch odiv
23:38 < OCTOTROG> Watch odiv at: http://crawl.berotato.org:8080/#watch-odiv [cbro]
23:39 < odiv> guess I'll start training spellcasting if I'm going to be a caster
23:39 < odiv> was thinking maybe ranged with portal projectile since I started wr
23:40 < isthmus> it's very reasonable to cast lvl 3 spells with FDA in the endgame
23:41 < isthmus> wonder if nebetia can tank a hydra
23:42 < zackoid> i don't think riposte is strong enough to be worth building your defenses around dodging
23:42 < zackoid> think of it more like a bonus

23:44 < odiv> oh
23:45 < odiv> eh
23:45 < odiv> I dunno really what I want to do.
23:45 < isthmus> looks like a good start
23:45 < isthmus> but I would stop cataloguing all the potions
23:45 < isthmus> :P
23:45 < odiv> I think I went too far on melee
23:46 < odiv> but I guess that frees me up to do other stuff if I want.
23:46 < isthmus> melee is good for you

01:23 < isthmus> anyone else here play crawl on linux?
01:24 < isthmus> apparently gammafunk built the 0.19 packages wrong, and it won't install locally
01:24 < isthmus> from the debian repos anyway
01:25 < isthmus> I can't be bothered to clone the git repository and build it from source, at least not on this install
01:31 < isthmus> I did let them know on ##crawl-dev

02:26 < isthmus> this experience on ##crawl-dev makes me never want to go back there again
02:26 < isthmus> gammafunk was very nice, but some fuckhead started giving me shit about using linux. 
02:26 < isthmus> this kind of shit is why I avoid ##crawl in the first place
02:27 < isthmus> last time I went to ##crawl-dev, there was some other rando who started insulting me
02:28 < isthmus> it was pretty mild really, but seems to have pissed me off tonight

10:13 < advil> isthmus: fwiw that guy is in fact a rando (also a tavern troll/weirdo of the less malicious variety) and is almost never in that channel
10:14 < advil> but nonetheless it does seem pretty non-ideal to let twelwe heckle someone in the background while you are sort of helping someone
10:14 < advil> *helping them
10:15 < advil> I think the devs are sort of overly inured to the strangeness that is the vocal part of the crawl player base
10:25 <@shmup> lol advil 
10:25 <@shmup> isthmus: gammafunk is always super cool and
10:26 <@shmup> i would have def white knighted u
10:28 < odiv> sounds like a geek social fallacy.
10:28 < odiv> the letting randos chirp off
10:28 < odiv> part
10:29 <@shmup> sounds like they need an asshole present at all times in -dev to just tell those people to shut up

11:58 < advil> did he paralyze before?
11:58 < advil> that seems kind of strong
11:58 < advil> I guess it is very short
12:03 < zackoid> odiv: is this related to your problem?
12:03 < zackoid> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/e35ada97585aeb0b39a6f28bfb849a75483a16ad
12:03 < zackoid> he always paralyzed but it's very short (like 1 turn until you have a good amount of invoke) and you have to get to that point first
12:04 < zackoid> i don't think uskayaw is overpowered at all, unless you have faith and are already way ahead of hte power curve
12:04 < advil> I think I'm ahead of the power curve
12:04 < advil> +5 slaying and a +8 long sword in lair
12:04 < advil> plus l2 demonic guardian
12:05 < zackoid> i think they should give usk a 0-piety ability that either debuffs or adds might or something based either on weapon base damage or ER or something
12:05 < zackoid> because he's most fun as a short blade user but easiest as a heavy armour axe wielder
12:05 < zackoid> and the latter do not need more god help and the former really do
12:06 < odiv> No, I don't htink so zackoid.
12:06 < zackoid> especially since poison gives 0 piety now, i have no idea how you get off the ground if you make lair with like a +3 short sword of venom as your best weapon
12:06 < odiv> It was just the putty[5] thing.
12:06 < zackoid> i read that as removing that option but i'm probably wrong
12:07 < odiv> I think it was a separate thing.
12:07 < odiv> putty is def not a rare terminal anyway.

09:32 < zackoid> were MD and HO less similar when the former still existed?
09:34 < advil> zackoid: yes iirc
09:35 < advil> there's a summary here: https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/whisper-farewell-when-you-leave-gimli
09:39 < zackoid> 'cause it seems to me like (new) HO are everyting MD were + better
09:39 < zackoid> but i wasn't around at the time
09:43 < advil> well I think that was the idea
09:44 < zackoid> the comments on that page about how armour sucks now because MD are gone and there are no heavy-armour races (certainly not mi!) are hilarious to me.
09:44 < advil> heh HO are worse at the crossbow skill
09:45 < advil> took me a while to decode that abbreviation
09:45 < advil> the magic stats are fairly different
09:45 < advil> mostly better
09:45 < advil> other stuff seems like smaller tweaks
09:45 < advil> !!apt ho

09:46 < advil> also some changes since those tables, like 1 fire
09:46 < advil> oh no I was just misreading
09:46 < zackoid> i'd rather have the invoke apt and/or the spell skills than +2 armour or +2 crossbows
09:47 < zackoid> "I think that’s not the right way of going on, mountain dwarves are essential characters for any fantasy related game, art, thing in the world."
09:47 < zackoid> mountain, specifically, dwarves are essential for any thing in the world.
09:47 < zackoid> i guess fantasy modifys things too, but still
09:49 < advil> people really cared, it seems
09:53 < zackoid> all the comments about how noobs need MD and they're the most popular and minotaurs are gimmicy and stupid are funny in retrospect too
09:53 < zackoid> given that Mi are by far the most played
09:55 < zackoid> the reason i brought it up was this, which i think was especially nonsense: https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/5fn0yr/new_player_how_i_got_addicted_to_the_game_but_now/
09:55 < zackoid> i'm going to quit playing because you removed backgrounds years before i started playing!
09:56 < zackoid> i would not recommend reading that though, it's overlong rambling nonsense
10:00 < advil> is it a coincidence that that's a new reddit account?  probably not
10:01 < zackoid> midway through i wondered if it was a sock puppet but i couldn't see what they were going for if so
10:01 < zackoid> if it was satire it's like 2 years late?
10:01 < advil> well it has lots of comments for that sub
15:08 < zackoid> Polymorphed uniques no longer keep their spells in certain obscure cases.
15:08 < zackoid> does that include nikola the juggernaut
15:28 < johnstein> top comment is a pretty good reply in that Reddit thread
15:28 < odiv> yeah but fuck reddit though
15:30 < johnstein> I really like the westworld, rocket league, and GoT subreddits
15:31 < odiv> I guess I'd probably like the westworld subreddit, but I kinda don't want to be complicit in their ruining of the Internet and world.
15:32 < johnstein> I didn't know they were ruining the world. I only really read those three
15:33 < odiv> I'm possibly giving them too much credit, but I think they really gave the racist right a foothold/base from which to spread their taint.
15:33 < johnstein> ah ok.
15:34 < odiv> heh, sorry
15:34  * odiv pictures johnstein backing away slowly.
15:34 < johnstein> hah
15:35 < johnstein> more like, I barely have time to really research it much and I basically live within MFC for most of my outside world exposure
15:35 < johnstein> so I definitely don't appreciate the issues
15:37 < johnstein> I wonder if I know who that poster was
15:40 < zackoid> yeah reddit in general is a shithole but there are individual subs that are good
16:49 <@slitherrr> what thread?
16:52 < odiv> https://www.reddit.com/r/dcss/comments/5fn0yr/new_player_how_i_got_addicted_to_the_game_but_now/
17:06 <@slitherrr> ah
17:06 <@slitherrr> i feel like the main problem he's really focused on is taking out zealots
17:06 <@slitherrr> at his level of play, that's almost literally the only change he'd be able to interact with anyway that isn't a convenience
17:06 <@slitherrr> well, sludge elf and md
17:07 <@slitherrr> he briefly talks about
17:07 <@slitherrr> maybe the real disconnect here is that people above a certain level of experience literally are incapable of seeing why removing a zealot class is a big deal
17:08 <@slitherrr> because getting to temple is taken for granted
17:08 <@slitherrr> and people at a low enough level of play that that isn't taken for granted are overestimating the overall game effect of that extra little bit of piety (which is minimal, but feels like more than that because their entire scope of the game is so relatively small)
17:09 <@slitherrr> and by "people" i really just mean the OP in that thread, i'm just extrapolating to attempt sympathy
17:09 < advil> well I do see that --dk was kind of easy (even worse, remember when --ck could have makhleb?) and that beginners won't fully appreciate that
17:09 < advil> !lg * --dk / won
17:09 < OCTOTROG> 544/64195 games for * (--dk): N=544/64195 (0.85%)
17:09 < advil> though that's a low winrate
17:10 < advil> !lg * --gl / won
17:10 <@slitherrr> yeah i mean DK was great the same way Be is great honestly
17:10 < OCTOTROG> 3567/314139 games for * (--gl): N=3567/314139 (1.14%)
17:11 <@slitherrr> anyway the point i'm getting at is that maybe what op is really asking for is an early game experience that is better at training good behavior into the player
17:11 <@slitherrr> like the whole, "don't immediately approach everything in LoS" insight is a huge leap, and it's never really conveyed in game
17:11 < advil> I've wondered about that sometimes
17:11 <@slitherrr> it's conveyed subtly through things
17:11 < advil> I kind of think --be is the opposite of that, for all it's easy in certain ways
17:12 <@slitherrr> press tab to win etc
17:12 < advil> one thing that would be good (but really hard to see how to do in console) is better signaling of noise
17:12 <@slitherrr> but it still applies, you still have to killhole stuff and can't go beelining into the huge room toward that single orc or bee or whatever
17:28 < advil> “You notice webbing strewn about the room and hear a chittering noise in the background.”
17:28 < advil> ok
17:31 < advil> really not sure what that was, it was just a room with a wolf spider
17:31 < advil> and a scroll of acquirement
17:32 < johnstein> I don't read the log unless it triggers a more prompt
17:34 < johnstein> unless I'm using fake lang jager,grunt

17:58 < advil> damn it
17:58 < advil> hit on the stairs, I completely mistimed that
17:59 < advil> the damn thing was at red for like 20 turns
18:27 < zackoid> i've thought a lot about how to display noise, on tiles some kind of concentric ring thing maybe?  it's hard to animate in a turn based game though
18:28 < zackoid> and auras overlap that space a lot already.  and it doesn't work when you can't see past that wall
18:28 < zackoid> but i would guess that most new players literally do not understand that noise is a thing
18:28 < zackoid> that you attrack more enemies to where you are fighting

09:44 < advil> hm it gave me dswn again
09:44 < advil> I guess by hyper rules I should accept
09:45 < advil> also same entry vault as my last game
09:47 < advil> it's a much lamer wn start, though
09:48 < zackoid> 100% of skill points in crossbows, a +0 dagger, and a book with only ignite poison in it?
09:49 < advil> a +2 dagger, 3 fighting, 1 staves, wand of random effects
09:50 < advil> d1 tele ring
09:50 < zackoid> 3 fighting makes that decent, relatively
09:52 < advil> ??powered by death
09:52 < advil> that's one of the op ones right?
09:53 < advil> I also have foul stench
09:53 < advil> though level 1 of foul stench is just rotting immunity
09:53 < zackoid> yeah pbd is great
09:53 < zackoid> pbp is meh i think
09:53 < advil> it's pbd

10:03 < advil> whoops
10:03 < advil> didn't know random effects could do that
10:04 < zackoid> me either
10:05 < zackoid> but i've zapped a /re like 5 times ever
10:05 < advil> I use it in early dungeon, though I don't usually use it if I'm next to something
10:06 < zackoid> i didn't even know it had damage zaps
10:06 < zackoid> ??wand of random effects
10:06 < OCTOTROG> wand of random effects[1/2]: An unreliable wand which acts like a random wand. You might cook Sigmund, or haste him. Doesn't include heal wounds. Does include draining -- the good gods won't like it if that happens.
10:06 < zackoid> ??wand of random effects[2
10:06 < OCTOTROG> wand of random effects[2/2]: !lg SGrunt 547 -tv
10:49 < advil> it is mostly damage zaps in my experience
10:49 < advil> but the not is why I wouldn't usually use it on adjacent monsters
10:50 < advil> I was going to die in a turn anyways in that case, due to an early scorpion

13:17 <@slitherrr> the hofi game i obliterated stupidly at the end of the tournament got cast into the abyss like five squares away from the rune one time
13:18 <@slitherrr> unfortunately it was in a vault with bunches of vortexes so he got teleported away a few turns later
13:18 <@slitherrr> but yeah so that's evidently a thing that can happen now
13:19 <@slitherrr> oh kim's not here, so that was kind of non sequitur
13:26 < odiv> hm who's ashleyy?
13:26 < odiv> Hi ashleyy!

14:17 < OCTOTROG> 10 games for zackoid (OpTm): 3x 6, 2x 10, 19, 11, 2, 5, 9
14:17 < odiv> since Op have such good stealth.
14:17 < zackoid> probably not the one to ask
14:17 < odiv> 19 is farther than I will get!

14:18 < zackoid> statue form is what makes optm work
14:18 < zackoid> i never found it, and i had only jsut found dragon form when i died
14:19 < zackoid> the frail 1 from hep is pretty brutal
14:19 < odiv> hm, yeah
14:19 < odiv> Yeah, I have dragon form now
14:19 < odiv> is that still fire/tmut?
14:19 < odiv> ??dragon form
14:20 < OCTOTROG> dragon form[1/3]: You're a dragon now! RAAAAWR! Breathe fire! Be tough (+50% hp) and strong! Gives +10 str, flight, rPois+ rFire++ rCold-, 34% GDR, 16 AC exactly, giant size (will nuke your EV). Base unarmed damage (including claws) = (18 + str*(2/3) + unarmed_skill). Gives Claws 3 (works for offhand punch) and 2 additional auxiliary attacks, bite and tail-slap.
14:20 < zackoid> no just pure
14:20 < zackoid> you haven't used spider form at all?
14:20 < odiv> no
14:20 < odiv> I usually skip it
14:20 < zackoid> i used to think that but i now think that is very unwise
14:20 < odiv> but I think I memorized it now for squishy reasons?
14:21 < odiv> yeah, it doesn't do more damage, so I would b-line for blade hands. :P
14:21 < zackoid> it does way more damage (to non-rp) and also boosts your defenses a lot
14:22 < zackoid> ??spider form
14:22 < OCTOTROG> spider form[1/2]: No weapons or armour, but you get (UC + 5) base damage (untransformed is UC + 3), a venomous bite, loads of EV (better than being a spriggan) and impeded spellcasting. Spider form has 2 AC, rPois- and gives 5 bonus dexterity.
14:23 < zackoid> i even use it against scorpions and ants and stuff
14:23 < odiv> yeah, usually I'd have armour so it would be lower AC I think right?
14:23 < odiv> nice
14:24 < zackoid> your buckler makes all the forms except statue a little less good for you but 4ac is not enough
14:24 < zackoid> really op, fe and dr are the only tms that will use all the forms widely
14:24 < zackoid> but it's basically the whole point of optm, because forms don't meld rings
14:25 < odiv> I wonder if I should ID this dagger.
14:25 < odiv> also I've been going dex for damage, assuming I don't need the int.
14:25 < odiv> damage + EV
14:26 < zackoid> i think dex only effect accuracy now
14:26 < zackoid> which effects damage somewhat
14:26 < odiv> even UC damage?
14:26 < odiv> ??blade hands
14:26 < OCTOTROG> blade hands[1/2]: A potent level 5 transmutation that grants a massive increase to unarmed damage but reduces spell success, melds gloves, weapons and shields. Also prevents wand usage while active. Base damage is 8 + (str+dex)/3 + UC. Does not stack with claws. 
14:26 < odiv> ??unarmed combat
14:26 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[1/3]: Fighting without a weapon. Base damage is 3 + UC skill (+2 per claws level (so +6 Tr, +2 Gh), +X for forms); delay 1.0 - UC/54.0; +2 to hit.
14:27 < zackoid> i'm not sure
14:27 < odiv> look slike it affects blade hands anyway
14:27 < odiv> unless that's out of date.
14:27 < odiv> ??unarmed combat[2
14:27 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[2/3]: Base for forms: Normal/Hog 3, Spider 5 (venom), Bat 1, Vampire Bat 2 (vamp), Ice 12 (freezing), Blade 8 + (str + dex) / 3, Statue (6 + str / 3), Dragon 18 + str*2/3, Lich 5 (drain). Form base damage scales with skill, just like normal punches.
14:27 < odiv> ah, and statue/dragon is only str
14:27 < odiv> so maybe now I should start going str...
14:28 < zackoid> i don't remember what i did
14:28 < zackoid> dragon and statue form also boost str
14:28 < odiv> yeah.
14:28 < odiv> might be worth continuing in dex to help my defenses.
14:29 < zackoid> i probably did mostly dex, maybe some int
14:29 < zackoid> hard to tell from log
14:32 < zackoid> return 8 + div_rand_round(you.strength() + you.dex(), 3);
14:32 < zackoid> looks like blade hands still uses both, which i wonder if that is intentional
14:33 < OCTOTROG> hyperodiv (L9 OpTm) killed the ghost of Potronius the Basher, a novice GrGl of Okawaru. (D:6) [cbro+]
14:33 < odiv> hmmm
14:33 < odiv> still not sure
14:33 < odiv> can see upsides to all possible buds
14:35 < zackoid> it feels weird to boost str on a race that can't wear armour
14:35 < odiv> yeah
14:40 < zackoid> ??giant size
14:40 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled giant_size in my learndb.
14:40 < zackoid> ??size
14:40 < OCTOTROG> size factor[1/2]: For evasion purposes: spider form and bat form are tiny (factor 6), spriggans and felids are little (factor 4), halflings and kobolds are small (factor 2), trolls ogres centaurs and nagas are large (factor -2), hydraform is big (-4), and dragonform is huge (factor -8).
14:43 < zackoid> so in my last optm game, i had 6/30/5 defenses, would have been 19/24/5 if i had dragon form up
14:43 < zackoid> still pretty terrible but i would aim for that in your spot i guess
14:44 < zackoid> i don't know how hep interacts with all that though
14:44 < zackoid> no ozo's and no statue form really hurt
14:44 < odiv> whenever I talk about defenses I think back to my centaur game wher I decided to go hexes and finished the game with something like 20 combined AC/EV
14:45 < odiv> probably not that bad.

15:26 < odiv> hmmmm
15:39 <@slitherrr> odiv *slow hasn't been so completely terrible for me as i expected
15:40 <@slitherrr> had a couple of games where i didn't feel like it contributed to my ultimate demise at all
15:40 < zackoid> i had one where i would have lived if i had kept using a *slow
16:11 < odiv> Yeah, I don't have any short blades skill right now. thinking of branching a bit.
16:11 < odiv> UC + stabbing maybe
16:11 < odiv> idunno
17:48 < odiv> oh right
17:48 < odiv> I still need to decide what to do.
17:48 < odiv> dammit
17:50 < odiv> hexbud or tankbud?
17:57 < odiv> hey zackoid, what was that math you did on kim's weapon choices?
17:57 < odiv> I can't remember exactly, but it was dire flail vs. great mace or something?
18:00 < zackoid> yeah, something like a +14 dire flail vs a +9 great mace of the same brand
18:01 < odiv> there's some complaints in SA thread about not having a good enough weapon by lair or w/e.
18:01 < odiv> and being disappointed
18:01 < odiv> and it's like, I've seen someone finish with a hand axe.
18:01 < odiv> quit whining and use hte best of what you have.
18:02 < zackoid> it's also true that what constitutes a good weapon is not at all obvious
18:03 < zackoid> as shown by new players who tend to overrate resist sticks 
18:03 < odiv> resist sticks?
18:04 < odiv> crap weapons with good resists?
18:04 < zackoid> yeah, or really any artefact with a lot of stuff in the {}
18:05 < odiv> so what do I do, zackoid?
18:05 < odiv> stabbing and hexdude?
18:05 < odiv> knight?
18:05 < zackoid> also probably because of the wiki people think vorpal is a terrible brand, and draining 
18:05 < odiv> the dark horse battlemage option?
18:05 < odiv> Yeah, that's weird.
18:05 < odiv> vorpal is great because then you don't have to worry about what you're hitting. you can just press tab.
18:06 < zackoid> i was underwhelmed by knight, but having a tank might be useful to you.  hexer is fun, though my hepl win was both me and it being hexers i think
18:06 < zackoid> haven't tried battlemage
18:06 < zackoid> !!lg . god=hep s=char,xl
18:06 < odiv> since I have that dagger maybe I'l go hexer.
18:06 < OCTOTROG> 2 games for zackoid (god=hep): HuIE (27), VSEn (27)
18:06 < zackoid> ok i'm wrong the hexer one wasn't dual-hexer, it was the ie
18:06 < zackoid> vsen was an orbsplat :(
18:08 < odiv> :(
18:08 < zackoid> fuckin' panlords with glaciate.  though i escaped that and then died thinking i could handle a few turns of orb guardian attacks
18:09 < odiv> you can always handle a few more turns of attacks.
18:10 < zackoid> not being able to use heal wounds is pretty brutal when you have the orb and you can't cblink anymore
18:11 < zackoid> i think pretty much anything but a VS would have survived that

18:30 < Kimtruck> ??antenae
18:30 < OCTOTROG> antenae ~ antennae[1/1]: Prevents wearing helmets and detects monsters in a 2/4/6 square radius of the player; detected monsters are represented by a red {. Gives sInv and removes head slot at 3.
18:30 < odiv> you get one of the worst ones, yay!
18:30 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L3 DsBe) killed Natasha. (D:2) [cbro+]
18:30 < odiv> oh also you're monstrous
18:30 < odiv> ??monstrous
18:30 < OCTOTROG> monstrous[1/3]: Pseudo-predefined mutation set guaranteeing 3 {body slot facet}s instead of 1, but no scales-type facet. 1 / 10 chance; gives "You feel monstrous as your demonic heritage exerts itself." message when you gain your first {body slot facet}.
18:30 < odiv> so you get all the body slot stuff
18:30 < odiv> including claws and hooves/talons
18:30 < Kimtruck> ??fingernails
18:30 < OCTOTROG> claws[1/1]: +2 unarmed damage per level and increases {punch} damage. Level 3 chops off hydra heads. The effects of claws are eliminated if you're wearing gloves, though at claws 3 you can't use the slot anyways.
18:30 < odiv> Yeah, so you get up to claws 3
18:31 < Kimtruck> ugh
18:31 < odiv> which is good if you get it early so you can go UC if you want.
18:31 < odiv> or not super if you get it late because you're already invested in a weapon and then you just don't get to wear gloves.
18:31 < Kimtruck> I do not think I want?

18:33 < OCTOTROG> unarmed combat[1/3]: Fighting without a weapon. Base damage is 3 + UC skill (+2 per claws level (so +6 Tr, +2 Gh), +X for forms); delay 1.0 - UC/54.0; +2 to hit.
18:33 < zackoid> i hate monstrous even if it might technically be good
18:33 < Kimtruck> so will these mutations just continue to develop?
18:33 < Kimtruck> ??demonspawn
18:33 < OCTOTROG> demonspawn[1/4]: A race that is pretty average, but gets 5 semi-random good mutations. Has a 1/10 chance of being {monstrous}. Demonspawn mutations are irrevocable and unalterable, and drawn from a special list (see ds mutation rules).
18:33 < OCTOTROG> sleevener (L5 FoMo) killed Terence. (D:3) [cbro+]
18:33 < Kimtruck> ??ds mutation rules
18:33 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[1/5]: Assuming you aren't monstrous, you get five facets, each consisting of three mutations (which usually just stack together). You will get one scales-type facet, one body-slot facet, two tier 2 facets, and one tier 3 facet. 
18:34 < Kimtruck> ??ds mutation rules[2
18:34 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[2/5]: The {scales}-type facets are icy blue, iridescent, molten, rough black, rugged brown, slimy green, thin metallic, or yellow scales, or alternatively thin skeletal structure, large bone plates, or a repulsion field. Body-slot facets: claws, horns, antennae, hooves, talons.
18:34 < Kimtruck> ??ds mutation rules[3
18:34 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[3/5]: Tier 2 facets: powered by death, powered by pain, demonic guardian, nightstalker, spiny, rot (rRot, foul stench), fire (flame cloud immunity, rF+, ignite blood), ice (freezing cloud immunity, rC+, icemail), magic shield.
18:34 < Kimtruck> ??ds mutation rules[4
18:34 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[4/5]: Tier 3 facets: robust (+30% HP), negative energy (rN+/rTorment/black mark), {augmentation} (+slay/spellpower scaling with HP), ice (rC+, freezing cloud immunity, passive freeze), fire (rF+, flame cloud immunity, hellfire). Ice/fire facets are incompatible, as are foul stench/ignite blood.
18:34 < Kimtruck> ??ds mutation rules[5
18:34 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[5/5]: If you are monstrous (1 in 10 chance), then you get 3 body-slot facets but you don't get scales. You still get 2 tier 2 facets and 1 tier 3 facet, for 6 facets total. Your first body slot mutation will come with the message, "You feel monstrous as your demonic heritage exerts itself."
18:36 < zackoid> Kimtruck: yes, in semi-random order you'll get more mutations or upgrades to existing mutations when you gain level

19:07 < OCTOTROG> scales[1/2]: A group of resistance-related scales mutations.

10:45 < zackoid> at least if you rely on the abilities procing
10:48 < advil> is it basically swappable?
10:48 < advil> I get to *** and **** pretty regularly with fireball, so I'm making use of paralyze and pain bond a lot
10:49 < zackoid> i think so, there might technically be a difference between the resting point and the post-faith resting point but i don't think it's noticable

12:28 < OCTOTROG> twister[1/2]: Free-flying {tornado}, fortunately confused and low power. Has 10000 HP, but you'll only ever encounter summoned twisters so you can just abjure it or run away and wait for it to time out.

12:56 <@slitherrr> man that reminds me that there's an untimed bazaar i haven't gone into yet
12:57 < odiv> ???elyvilon
12:57 < odiv> nice
12:57 < OCTOTROG> The divinity of healing. Most reliable source of protection from being killed (see {divine protection}), but will impose penance (i.e. not answer your requests for help) if you kill living creatures while invoking said protection. Provides healing invocations, but dislikes cannibalism, the use of necromancy, and allowing allies to die. / Elyvilon grants piety for exploring the dungeon.
12:57 < OCTOTROG> This piety can be used for: self-healing, monster {pacification}, {purification}, {divine vigour}, {divine protection}. / <crate_> no you fucking moccasin the stairs are right there dont walk away from them <crate_> no why <crate_> arghh / ELYVILON! E-Explore! L-Levels!!! Y-Your! V-Violent! I-Inquisition! L-Leaves! O-Out! N-Nothing!!! Explore Levels!! Your Violent Inquisition Leaves

12:57 < odiv> haha
12:57 < odiv> that's pretty good
12:57 < odiv> fuckin' shaman
12:58 < advil> do you have enough piety?
12:58 < advil> I've only played ely when piety came from pacifying
12:58 <@slitherrr> piety is fine
12:58 <@slitherrr> there's a "faith i've been thinking about since i've been using ely a bit more now
12:59 <@slitherrr> i wasn't much in the beginning because drsk has lots of options
12:59 < advil> looks like you're using lesser/greater healing _way_ less than one would on old ely
13:00 < advil> I had nearly 1300 casts of lesser healing by that point in the game
13:03 <@slitherrr> oh nice, shapeshifter dragons count
13:03 <@slitherrr> yeah since i don't get piety by pacifying, i only pacify as an emergency
13:04 < zackoid> i thought new ely was really boring, never tried the old one.
13:04 < zackoid> advil: it has that damage display for all monsters now, i think it tries to show weapon damage too
13:05 < zackoid> which is good because i've never understood how that works
13:05 < odiv> slitherrr: so do undead ones
13:06 <@slitherrr> ??purification
13:06 < OCTOTROG> purification[1/1]: Removes negative conditions (Rot, Poison, Slow, Sick, Petr, Conf, but not Drain) and restores all stats.
13:06 <@slitherrr> so not corrosion i guess?
13:08 < advil> probably not...I learned recently that cancellation is supposed to remove corrosion though

17:03 < OCTOTROG> bribe branch[1/1]: Gozag ability which costs 3000 gold. While active, monsters have a chance to become either friendly or "good-neutral" (like freed slaves) when seeing you, until your money wears out, upon which time they become pacified.
17:04 < advil> it's a good thing they added the stand & fight option for escape around when banishment gained variable depth
17:04 < odiv> so do I bribe zot:5 and stuff?
17:05 < zackoid> i'd bribe as much of zot as possible
17:05 < advil> I haven't played since they improved that ability, it was sort of a joke when I tried it
17:05 < zackoid> does it have a cost ceiling?
17:05 < odiv> oh, I have no idea how it worked
17:05 < odiv> I thought maybe it was until that 3k ran out
17:05 < odiv> but it's until all of it?
17:05 < odiv> hm
17:05 < zackoid> no i think you're right
17:06 < zackoid> but i didn't think it had a fixed cost
17:06 < odiv> so should I try to learn blink+apport?
17:06 < odiv> I have a manual of tloc
17:06 < odiv> and I just found a potion of xp
17:07 < odiv> then again, I'm a minotaur.
17:07 < advil> you could probably learn blink+apport without either a potion of xp or a manual
17:07 < zackoid> i always like blink, what do you have left and what would spend it on instead?
17:07 < advil> that's like one depths monster, even with mi penalty
17:08 < zackoid> nah, not in heavy armour
17:08 < zackoid> maybe one depths floor
17:08 < zackoid> or do you mean the pot?
17:08 < advil> hm my most recent mi took tloc up to 10 (in chain), that seems too high
17:08 < advil> (for exactly those two spells)
17:08 < zackoid> to get it to <5% it probably is 10
17:09 < zackoid> odiv: remember to drink the pot when you're at like 90%+ to the next XL
17:10 < odiv> yeah, that's probably right
17:10 < odiv> that it's too high

11:47 < roj> yeah, it was in an ice cave, guraded by those damn summoning turrets.
11:47 < odiv> some dodging wouldn't hurt eventually
11:47 < odiv> but yeah, right track.
11:47 < roj> I got the rPoi boots after doing all of lair 1 and 2, and okwaru gave me thim as 4 spiders hit my neck.

11:48 < roj> I haven't seen any. I've seen some staves.
11:48 < roj> I've left most of the wands and staves behind.
11:48 < odiv> You might want to go (x)bows instead of throwing
11:49 < odiv> since you're 2H
11:49 < odiv> though you've already got a bunch in throwing
11:49 < roj> HAven't seens an xbow, is why.
11:49 < roj> ARgh, I'm traiing unarmed.

11:50 < OCTOTROG> Fighting without a weapon. Base damage is 3 + UC skill (+2 per claws level (so +6 Tr, +2 Gh), +X for forms); delay 1.0 - UC/54.0; +2 to hit. / Base for forms: Normal/Hog 3, Spider 5 (venom), Bat 1, Vampire Bat 2 (vamp), Ice 12 (freezing), Blade 8 + (str + dex) / 3, Statue (6 + str / 3), Dragon 18 + str*2/3, Lich 5 (drain). Form base damage scales with skill, just like normal punches. /
11:50 < OCTOTROG> Auxiliary attacks are /extra/ melee attacks using body parts. You can get auxiliary attacks by having hooves, horns, talons, fangs, a beak, or a large muscular tail. Unarmed Combat skill does not affect these. However, if you have Unarmed Combat skill and are not using a shield or two-handed weapon, you do get an offhand punch.
11:50 < roj> Ah, so you're right.
11:51 < roj> Well.

15:13 < odiv> I also found a book shop with geomancy like 4 squares away from the staff.

15:16 < odiv> ??statue form
15:16 < OCTOTROG> statue form[1/2]: Grants 17 + pow/10 AC, +30% HP, +2 Str, -2 Dex. Makes the base cost of an action 15 instead of 10, like the slow spell. Melds gloves, boots, bardings, and body armour. Provides rElec, rN+, 50% rTorm, rRot+, and poison immunity. 3 + str/3 bonus UC damage and 50% bonus on all melee. Gargoyles can't cast this spell.
15:16 < odiv> ??statue form[2
15:16 < OCTOTROG> statue form[2/2]: Gives plate armour GDR, halves damage from torment and gives rotting resistance. Prior to 0.16, gargoyles get 4 less AC than other races in statue form (and still lose all of their innate AC)! In 0.16 and later, gargoyles can't cast it at all. Makes you take extra damage from shatter, but you knew that already.
15:17 < odiv> I'm guessing statue form is earth/tmut?
15:17 < odiv> I think?
15:20 < odiv> ooh, book of changes

Moving on liquefied ground has a -3 player movement malus. Applies slow movement effect to monsters. Doesn't affect flying, clinging, insubstantials; cannot be cast by these.
15:31 < odiv> honestly what good is that though?
15:31 < odiv> ??leda's liquefaction[2
15:31 < OCTOTROG> leda's liquefaction[2/2]: You will see a lot of "Your unstable footing causes you to fumble your attack."

16:08 < zackoid> don't open doors
16:09 < odiv> they were sleeping together.
16:09 < zackoid> statue form is earth/tmut yes
16:09 < odiv> this stabbing thing is working out well
16:09 < zackoid> all the forms are dual schools you would expect except dragon which is pure tmut
16:10 < odiv> but yeah, I need something to do when stabbing isn't going to work anymore.

13:29 < odiv> man
13:30 < odiv> just found my 3rd Enchant Weapon scroll.
13:30 < odiv> on Depths 4.
13:31 < odiv> I have a +2 Demon Blade and a trove that wants a +6 demon blade.
13:31 < odiv> steep order.
13:48 < zackoid> seems like troves are more common now
13:49 < odiv> yeah, it feels that way
13:49 < odiv> so annoying about these scrolls though
13:49 < odiv> I probably wasted one on ID
13:50 < odiv> so I would have had enough by now.
13:50 < odiv> But do I waste 4 of these apparently rare scrolls on a trove?
13:50 < odiv> I guess probably.
13:50 < odiv> but I'd like to enchant up a great mace
13:51 < OCTOTROG> sleevener (L14 FoMo) reached level 6 of the Lair of Beasts. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
13:52 < zackoid> i wouldn't use them on the trove unless i already had a well enchanted weapon
13:52 < odiv> yeah, that sucks. :(
13:52 < odiv> maybe I should have gone with the +7 battleaxe
13:53 < odiv> I guess not much to get that axe up to mindelay
13:53 < odiv> and I could just equip it anyway for resists.
13:53 < odiv> I don't think I'm going to get to firestorm
13:53 < odiv> so I should put my xp into something worthwhile.
13:57 < OCTOTROG> hyperodiv (L27 FoFE) reached level 5 of the Depths. (Depths:5) [cbro+]
13:58 < odiv> still want to use this: the amulet of the First Ghosts {Reflect MR- Str+5 Int+2 SH+6}
13:59 < odiv> instead of this: the amulet of the Locust (around neck) {rF++ MR+ Regen+ MP+9}
13:59 < odiv> but the latter is just too good.
13:59 < odiv> I could do evoc for energy staff.
14:01 < odiv> the +7 battleaxe of the Boiling Point {freeze, rF++ rC- Str+2 Dex+2}
14:01 < odiv> hm
14:01 < odiv> I should have just gone with that, in hindsight.
14:01 < zackoid> that second amulet is amazing, why would you want reflect?
14:01 < zackoid> are you still using that quarterstaff?
14:01 < odiv> now that I'm at mindelay for great mace
14:01 < odiv> I have a large shield
14:02 < odiv> Nah, I finally got the guts to unwield
14:02 < odiv> that +intstr was nice though.
14:02 < odiv> er
14:02 < odiv> +10int
14:02 < zackoid> after vaults there's not that much reflectable anyway
14:02 < odiv> yeah, you're right,.
14:02 < zackoid> plus you have spells so it's not like yo ulack for ranged damage
14:02 < odiv> I'm not using it anyway.
14:02 < odiv> again, you're right. :)
14:04 < zackoid> i might be wrong about the reflectables part
14:04 < odiv> +6SH and reflect on top of my large shield just sounds like a lot of fun.
14:05 < odiv> but yeah, the other amulet is too good, like I said.
14:05 < odiv> it's just upside on top of upside.
14:05 < odiv> wish I had found shatter
14:05 < odiv> for V:5
14:05 < odiv> because I'm a bit worried.
14:05 < odiv> if there's a warden or ten I could be screwed.
14:07 < zackoid> ^dump hyperodiv

14:07 < odiv> ood would be nice maybe
14:07 < zackoid> that's some nice jewelery
14:07 < odiv> yeah!
14:08 < odiv> that battleaxe of the Boiling Point might be worth switching to. :(
14:09 < zackoid> with that much str (even after the str-5 ring) you should think about ADA or ring mail or something
14:09 < odiv> yeah, I haven't found anything good.
14:09 < odiv> and I'm spending a lot of time in statue anyway.
14:09 < odiv> but yeah, maybe ada is the thing.
14:09 < zackoid> ah right forgot about statue form

17:38 < advil> since you train invoc for usk
17:38 < zackoid> yeah but that's the problem, just another cost that is applie to spell casters that isn't to heavy armour

17:51 < advil> I have no idea
17:52 < zackoid> heh.  Crawl Combat(R).
17:52 < advil> I think it might be

18:34 < zackoid> because you can't pray?
18:53 < advil> that and fed has piety decay now
18:53 < advil> did not used to
18:54 < advil> I think the praying in principle shouldn't matter, because you still get piety when the corpse eventually decays

15:05 < odiv> shmup: Yeah, if you can get people over to playtest it sounds good.
15:05 < odiv> I want to try to balance it a little bit before I get people over.
15:05 <@shmup> did you do a nice job of sticking to color archetypes?
15:05 <@shmup> to an extent
15:05 < odiv> I had some idea, but eh
15:05 <@shmup> yeah hm
15:05 < odiv> tried to make themes.
15:05 <@shmup> right
15:05 < odiv> I can't remember what they all are though.
15:06 < odiv> WG landfall, RB goblins...
15:06 < odiv> the rest is hazy. :)
15:06 <@shmup> lol
15:06 < odiv> I haven't touched it in over 6 months I bet.
15:06 <@shmup> do you have a preferred way to handle brackets or do you just pen/paper?
15:06 <@shmup> some software/webapp i dont know about
15:06 < odiv> Oh, I haven't even finished it and I probably wouldn't get that many people. :(
15:07 < odiv> I'd probably bring it to FNM honestly.
15:07 < odiv> so I'm considering stripping the valuable cards out.
15:07 <@shmup> yeah now that im a homeowner and can sorta get 6-8 people over fairly easily.. i think i wanna homecube?
15:07 < odiv> Nice, yeah.
15:07 <@shmup> probably put on the wildest sleeves as to be 100% sure These Are Mine
15:07 < odiv> I had a bunch of poker when I first got my place :)
15:08 <@shmup> oh right you are a pokerman
15:08 < odiv> I will probably have to go to FNM to get 8 people.
15:08 < odiv> and then hope nothing gets stolen.
15:08 < odiv> Then the LGS can charge $5 or whatever to play and can pay out in prize packs.
15:08 <@shmup> word
15:08 <@shmup> how big of a cube?
15:09 < odiv> I was going to start with 360, but was having trouble.
15:09 < odiv> let me see if I can find it. I have a meeting.
15:09 <@shmup> no sweat
15:09 < odiv> http://www.cubetutor.com/viewcube/21450
15:10 < odiv> Kind of a mess and I forget the exact themes, but I've been trying to cut and add down to 360 I think.
15:10 < odiv> Basically I went through my whole collection and threw anything cubeworthy in.
15:10 <@shmup> cool man yeah
15:10 < odiv> THen I bought some singles to put in
15:10 < odiv> then I went through and stripped out a bunch.
15:10 < odiv> and I still need to.
15:10 < odiv> and then probably re-add. :)
15:14 <@shmup> OK here I go http://puu.sh/sNdB6/1821806d98.png
15:14 <@shmup> yeah ill def have to do some single purchases at some point
15:20 < odiv> and then buy a shit ton of sleeves.
15:20 < odiv> and matching lands. :)
15:20 < odiv> will probably go with some BFZ lands.
15:20 < odiv> anyway, meeting
15:21 <@shmup> oh shit youre right i do need more fuckin sleeves goddamnit
15:21 <@shmup> i bought 400 but need 500
15:22 < apoch> how do you shuffle with sleeves?
15:22 <@shmup> i use 3 techniques
15:22 <@shmup> one i just ruffle em together, whatever the name is. two i do a regular throw cards into the other hand shuffle. 3rd is the best though and involves a table and maybe i can find it
15:23 <@shmup> well 4th is you just lay out each card across say.. 6 piles. that's what people do in events usually.
15:24 <@shmup> these arent your shitty penny sleeves, also. those real real thing ones you have maybe seen.
15:24 <@shmup> thin
15:25 < apoch> I got a set of sleeves with my copy of thieves market and it seemed like it'd be a pain to shuffle the way I normally do
15:26 <@shmup> so the bottom is sealed right, and the top is open? #1 reason to keep cards going the same way. the technique is really about letting the close ends of the cards slide into each other as you shuffle.. which is weird to type and you maybe cant visualize

19:42 < zackoid> oh right they buffed them
19:42 < zackoid> still is 2 base dam enough to make them op?
19:42 < zackoid> i would guess the biggest difference is that you've never had a char with that much short blade skill to start
19:42 < advil> maybe not
19:42 < advil> ??war axe
19:42 < OCTOTROG> war axe[1/2]: (axes; +0 acc / 11 dam / 1.5 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A military axe with a long haft and a single-bladed head.
