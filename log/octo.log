16:21 < zackoid> shmup: are you making a graph of the worst addicted players
16:26 <@shmup> lol
16:26 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/ghost-of-the-week.txt
16:27 <@shmup> but i'm trying to filter out bots, is the thing. i keep a list and only have 2 in it. there is no good query at the moment. was talking in dev about it.
16:28 <@shmup> i'm also working on a thing for http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/
16:28 < zackoid> that is not a public directory
16:28 <@shmup> octo / log
16:29 <@shmup> i'm gonna add an input up top for regex filtering. will not output any of our log here by default.
16:29 <@shmup> i started fresh so no previous history in log
16:29 < zackoid> i mean i just get a login prompt
16:29 <@shmup> yes, u: octo p: log
16:30 <@shmup> it's nothing atm. pointless to link really
16:30 < zackoid> oh
16:31 <@shmup> i can always grep my own log but earlier when you forgot the git command, i wish i had a frontend to quickly regex/grep shit out
16:31 <@shmup> from here
16:41 < zackoid> what, you don't log all of our wonderful banter for posterity?
16:48 <@shmup> haha
16:48 <@shmup> well by principle i log everything irc related :P
16:49 <@shmup> this is just a new special log, located elsewhere with permissions to read, ignoring things like nick changes etc

21:20 <@shmup> zackoid: thoughts on http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/dev.php?search=git
21:21 <@shmup> i could make it so that i dont wrap the query in .* 
21:21 <@shmup> or i could leave it raw and just let the user do what is needed
21:21 <@shmup> aka they would need to .* around things, otherwise the pattern matching just returns the single pattern found in each line. not the whole line. . or i could revise that i guess
21:22 <@shmup> i could also give options to check like "dont search nicks"
21:31 < odiv> zackoid: Yeah, I just meant like what does your question mean?
21:31 < odiv> Obv you figured it out. :P

21:39 < zackoid> odiv: i ended up clearing them.  i just don't know how you survive if you don't.
21:42 < zackoid> shmup: so just a searchable log?  i don't see where the git happens
21:43 < odiv> Oh, you fuckin' book it. :P
21:44 < odiv> or you play tele roulette
21:44 < odiv> I should play again. I miss it.
21:51 < zackoid> but everything's gonna cut you off at the choke point
21:51 < zackoid> and tele is really dangerous since you have like a 40% chance of landing in the uncleared part

23:14 <@shmup> oh zackoid no i just wanted to grep _this chan_ and i could look at previous commands you've done, etc
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: tell me the diff bot searching abilities sometime
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: i made another page to just grep git and list links to the raw source files (loads faster) but i'm not sure what all the search features are in botland
23:53 <@shmup> like you can search commit names? last commits? etc
23:56 < zackoid> i don't know that bot very well since i don't even know what it's called and don't know if there are any docs
23:56 < zackoid> one downside to having octotrog relay everything
23:57 < zackoid> there was a dblist entry that had basic help on all the bot operators but now i don't even remember what that was

00:04 < zackoid> ?!spen
00:04 < OCTOTROG> {SPEN}: <zackoid>	you sleep anything that you can sleep, you confuse anything you can confuse, you tukima anything with a weapon that you can tukima, you blind anything you can blind, you go invis against anything without sinv, in that order
00:04 < zackoid> i'm sure i was verbing tukima as a joke but it still hurts to read.
00:05 < zackoid> also i'd revise that because invis doesn't really go at the end, it depends.  invis has a lot of defensive benefits.
00:20 <@shmup> verbing things is nice all the time
00:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?search=slow
00:20 <@shmup> i can improve big time but if you have a thought let me know.. won't except patterns atm lol
00:22 <@shmup> things that are bad about linking to raw is line numbers are less useful :P i think i'll include regular link and [raw] after it
00:23 <@shmup> johnstein only once said "by johnstein"
00:23 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?grep=johnstein
00:42 < johnstein> shmup: authentication required
03:23 < Rotatell> johnstein: Unstable branch on crawl.beRotato.org updated to: 0.19-a0-1068-g99dd0f4 (34)
08:53 <@shmup> johnstein: octo/log
08:59 < advil> maybe useful to restrict to just the main source directory
09:00 < advil> to have an option that does that I mean
09:01 < advil> e.g. if you search for "hellion" there's a ton of misc results that you may or may not want, but the key link w.r.t. the source is just mon-data.h
09:03 <@shmup> that's fair, you mean the crawl-ref/source dir right?
09:03 < advil> yeah
09:03 < advil> or I suppose another way to do it would be by file type
09:04 < advil> .h vs .c vs .des vs misc or something
09:04 < advil> since you often do want to exclude .h from a grep
09:05 <@shmup> hm. def more thought needed.
09:05 <@shmup> also how i'm parsing results is kinda fucked. grep returns information separated by : and i'm being lazy and splitting on : atm.
09:06 <@shmup> however if the result actually contains a :, i'm gonna be doing things _wrong_
09:06 < advil>  haha that explains what's going on with the .des results then
09:06 <@shmup> yeah haha
09:06 <@shmup> exactly
09:06 <@shmup> this was a 12a thing i started and shouldn't have (cause 12a)
09:07 < advil> also uh stupid-ish question, have you played with github's code search?
09:07 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=hellion
09:07 <@shmup> i also think it might be best to just let you use raw regex, however having to do .*foo.* all the time (99% of the time) could be annoying. maybe i could compensnate somehow.
09:07 < advil> not that doing your own thing is bad or anything
09:08 <@shmup> yeah really i use that and just grepping locally
09:08 <@shmup> but .. a few of my browsers for whatever reason, choke on github cause it loads the fancy result page w/ line nums and shit.
09:08 <@shmup> i cant explain why it loads so poorly for me if a large file
09:08 <@shmup> so i always prefer to see the raw result
09:09 <@shmup> honestly man, i dont even know why i did the git thing. i just wanted an irc log search lol
09:09 < advil> heh
09:09 <@shmup> then zackoid, very late, made a comment about "not seeing the git thing" and
09:09 <@shmup> unsure exactly what he wanted.. i started a thing
09:09 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/?search=%21lg
09:10 <@shmup> i just wanna do that sometimes to remind myself of syntax
09:10 <@shmup> i Learn By Example (or never learn cause i rely on examples all the time)
09:10 < advil> hmm
09:11 < advil> we should put the lg docs in the topic
09:11 < advil> I can't set it myself though
09:11 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/docs/listgame.md
09:12 < advil> I do actually sometimes search the logs in crawl-dev for bot syntax too
09:17 < zackoid> shmup: i just meant the button said something about git on it, so i wasn't sure what i was looking at.  our i was hallucinating becuase i was tired.
09:58 < zackoid> advil: getting a lil' salty on the tavern huh
10:03 < advil> haha yes
10:03 < advil> it'll get ignored though probably
10:03 < advil> tavern is such a dysfunctional community
10:04 < advil> I get more and more fed up with it as time goes on

10:05 <@advil> hi :)
10:05 <@shmup> it did not say git on the button zackoid! lol
10:06 <@zackoid> advil: i agree and i stopped reading it for a long time.  but i think that particularly comment was just a n00b.
10:06 <@shmup> link?
10:06 <@shmup> to the advil-thread
10:06 <@advil> oh my saltiness is just a side-comment on a thread that was already split from something else
10:06 <@advil> zackoid: nago isn't a noob
10:06 <@advil> he used to be a blue name even
10:07 <@zackoid> ah i was referring to the guy who mentioned orb guardians to begin with
10:07 <@advil> lethediver is sort of maybe, if that's who you mean
10:07 <@advil> I kind of suspect lethediver is a sock
10:07 <@zackoid> i logged into the tavern for the first time ever yesterday, and almost posted a comment.  WHY THE HELL is the unread-thread text bolded, eye-searing bright red?
10:08 <@zackoid> heh you think that of everyone.
10:08 <@advil> well there's a continuous stream of semi-trolling noobs with weird strong opinions
10:08 <@advil> I guess crawl could just breed those
10:08 <@shmup> it is a nice looking phpBB forum
10:09 <@shmup> i never visit here, really. very very seldomly
10:09 <@advil> shmup https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=20967
10:10 <@advil> anyways that attitude about sequell is all over tavern, it annoys me
10:11 <@shmup> really? ha
10:11 <@shmup> > Where are the bot-queries-always-have-the-right-answers guys when they are really needed?
10:11 <@shmup> you are referring to that right?
10:11 <@zackoid> well it's true that just posting queries has a very low signal
10:11 <@advil> yeah
10:12 <@advil> it's true that there've been a few people who tended to use sequell queries incompetently in arguments and wouldn't stop
10:12 <@advil> bcadren was on iirc
10:12 <@zackoid> but by now people should be able to intuit what the data is actually saying, because the bias is the same one in most cases
10:12 <@advil> yeah
10:13 <@advil> some day I'm gonna import sequell data into some of the more sophisticated models we use in research
10:13 <@advil> it's not even as if the biases in the data can't be dealt with
10:14 <@zackoid> is there anything as powerful as player skill in the data you work with (that is not directly correlated with something easy to identify)?
10:14 <@shmup> that would be v interesting, advil 
10:16 <@advil> zackoid: probably not, but player skill should be correlated with a ton of easy things
10:16 <@advil> # games, # wins, for two
10:16 <@shmup> yeah
10:16 <@zackoid> it is DEFINITELY not correlated with games, heh
10:16 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained within wins
10:16 <@advil> and there is a lot of stuff around modeling variation between subjects
10:17 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained when obtaining runes (w/o win) in general
10:17 <@advil> I'm sure it correlates with # games, if you factor in individual differences
10:17 <@advil> there are very few people who could play hundreds of games without getting better in some way
10:18 <@zackoid> the guy who won shmup ghostkill award had 2000 in 3 months without winning.
10:18 <@zackoid> turns would be better, probably.
10:18 <@zackoid> maybe hours.
10:18 <@advil> well, but correlation has no commitment to there not being outliers
10:19 <@zackoid> yeah though i don't think that was really an extreme outlier.  bad players rack up games because they end so fast.
10:19 <@advil> and I would be surprised if even that guy didn't have some measurable improvement over those 2000 games
10:19 <@advil> just not improvement that involves winning
10:19 <@zackoid> and also most people, after they first win, get worse before they get better again i think.
10:19 <@advil> probably "skill" is fairly high dimensional
10:21 <@shmup> that person was likely a bot, also
10:21 <@advil> but I think you are thinking in too categorical terms :)
10:21 <@shmup> i kinda wish bots were allowed by required tagging in crawlrc heh
10:21 <@zackoid> i don't think that was a bot.
10:21 <@advil> I'm 95% sure that if you plotted # games and # wins, there'd be a clear linear correlation (even if that's not the best way to model it)
10:22 <@zackoid> well games vs wins would.  or do you mean skill vs games and wins
10:22 <@advil> well, I'm not sure that skill makes sense as a single dimensional-value
10:22 <@advil> but wins is a proxy for skill, presumably
10:22 <@zackoid> probably not.  i just meant that you can't win without playing another game
10:23 <@shmup> man
10:23 <@shmup> deep learning on some data would be fun

11:19 <@zackoid> well, 1.
11:23 <@zackoid> fortunately i looked at that before going into a half-hour diversion of looking up lava orc nutrition mechanics
16:50 <@zackoid> advil: R1 faculty sure are inbred huh
16:51 <@advil> probably
16:51 <@advil> it's worst at the top schools
16:51 <@advil> it's more like the top 10 in any given field are inbred
16:52 <@zackoid> i'm looking over where our faculty got their phds and it's the same handful of schools over and over.
16:52 <@zackoid> plus one santa cruz linguist, so i guess their linguistics department is better than the average there.
16:52 <@advil> yeah it's very godo
16:52 <@advil> *good
16:52 <@advil> (that's where I went)
16:53 <@zackoid> i saw a paper a few months ago that was using a network model for this and it verified that nobody hires from schools 'beneath' them, so at the top you can only hire for like 5 schools.
16:53 <@advil> probably the three ling departments with the best placement are MIT, UCSC, UMass Amherst
16:53 <@advil> maybe Stanford
16:53 <@advil> you've got all four I think?
16:54 <@zackoid> do we even have 4 linguistics faculty
16:54 <@advil> oh maybe no MIT
16:54 <@advil> 3 umass, one stanford, one (retired) UCSC
16:55 <@zackoid> uh shit i hope she retired in the last couple months
16:55 <@advil> I don't think so but I don't know the exact dates
16:56 <@zackoid> well shit.
16:56 <@zackoid> this should only be active faculty.
16:56 <@advil> she still has an appointment as a research associate
16:56 <@advil> http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/associates/gunlogson_christine/index.html
16:57 <@zackoid> ok, that's likely, this pool is all research + teaching staff.
17:00 <@zackoid> advil: since you were a product, is umass-boston a big thing or is the system just overwriting all umass schools with the first on the list
17:00 <@advil> umass boston is not a big thing
17:00 <@advil> "UMass" means UMass Amherst
17:01 <@advil> UMass Boston / UMass Lowell are ok local schools, lots of commuters / returning students, I think they might be R2s?
17:01 <@zackoid> i was suspicious because while i've heard of lowell i've never even heard of boston
17:01 <@advil> it's very unlikely that anyone who works at rochester has a Ph.D from UMass Boston
17:01 <@advil> (and no one in ling does)
17:01 <@zackoid> and a lot of the schools have really dumb names so i'm guessing some software is fucking it up
17:02 <@advil> I know someone who taught there through tenure and it was a shitty job
17:02 <@zackoid> heh one of them is a linguist
17:02 <@zackoid> and her CV says amherst.  bleh.
17:03 <@zackoid> actually 2/5 are linguists.  one more thing on the pile of corrections.
17:03 <@advil> haha good thing you know me!
17:04 <@zackoid> i did suspect something fishy but it's possible i would have been too drained of this crap to look it up if you hadn't provided an easy resource.
17:04 <@zackoid> so thanks.
17:05 <@advil> maybe this is why the dean's office always makes us give this stuff to them in like 3 different formats
17:07 <@advil> I think at least 3 people in your ling dept have degrees from UMass

17:20 <@zackoid> advil: is there any effort to make faculty have like perfectly standardized CV formats?
17:20 <@advil> haha no
17:20 <@advil> there's always some semi-standardized word template that they want us to use to convey the same information in addition to the CV though
17:21 <@advil> part if the issue is that bib standards vary by field

17:58 <@advil> well, I spent most of the afternoon doing bs administrative stuff too
17:58 <@advil> just from a desk in ottawa :-P
18:03 <@zackoid> are you writing up there?  you can't possibly have actual vacation time
18:03 <@advil> well, if you mean vacation time in a technical sense, keep in mind that most academics are on a 9 month salary
18:04 <@zackoid> yeah, but you're expected to fund yourself doing more work through the summer, no?
18:04 <@advil> so I'm not really even being paid for the summer (though I get my 9-month salary distributed through 12 months, also common)
18:04 <@advil> yeah, that is the culture
18:05 <@advil> I did take a real 10 day vacation in june, to Paris ;-)
18:07 <@zackoid> the first and last until you make tenure?
18:07 <@advil> there's not an expectation per se that I augment up to 12 months, but there is also the expectation that I don't sit around playing stardew valley all summer

19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[4/5]: Finally, stab damage gets an additional bonus multiplier of (12 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / {stab bonus}) / 12 for all weapons.
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[5
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[5/5]: (lower is better): sleeping/paralysed = 1, netted/webbed/petrifying/petrified = 2, invisible/confused/fleeing/ally = 4, distracted = 6
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[1
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[1/5]: A stab with a short blade does increased damage: (dam+bonus)*mult, where bonus depends on your dex as well as your stealth and weapon skills and is capped at 30, and mult depends on your stealth/weapon skills and the type of stab (sleep/paralysis is best). Non-short blades don't get a bonus and have lower mult. Daggers get bonus doubled (but still capped at 30).
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[3
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[3/5]: For short/long blades and one-handed polearms, stab damage gets a bonus multiplier of (10 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / ({stab bonus} + 2 (if using a long blade or one-handed polearm))) / 10

12:28 <@shmup> but i didnt check my race abilities
12:29 <@shmup> ???naga
12:29 < OCTOTROG> The player race has sInv, rPois, a poisonous spit attack, +5 stealth apt and natural stealth boosts, plus xl/3 natural AC. In return, they have a penalty to movement speed, receive halved base AC for body armours, and cannot wear boots (though bardings have 4 base AC). Nagas gain constriction at xl13. / Universally slow-moving (but normal attack speed); {Naga mage}s and {Greater Naga}
12:29 < OCTOTROG> use haste and conjurations to deal with this. All naga also have constriction. Basic {naga} are weak, while {Naga Warriors} are bulky and hit hard. A {Salamander} is essentially fire-themed Naga. Also see: {Naga Ritualist} {Salamander Firebrand} {Salamander Stormcaller} {Naga Sharpshooter}
12:38 <@zackoid> they can spit poison yeah
12:38 <@zackoid> and you really need to abuse it to survive
12:38 <@zackoid> they're strong eventually but one of the worst starting races because you can't run from anything

10:01 <@shmup> you can really really really start out unluckily as a caster
10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a rat on D:1, with 4 points after 46 turns and 0:01:06. [cbro+]
10:02 <@shmup> lol

10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a giant gecko on D:1, with 2 points after 44 turns and 0:00:34. [cbro+]
10:02 <@zackoid> it's not so much unlucky as you're lucky when you're not killed by the first think you meet.
10:03 <@zackoid> giant gecko is probably the wost possible first monster now.
10:03 <@zackoid> rats or bats are the best.
10:04 <@shmup> yeah, fair. lucky wasn't even what i was feeling
10:05 <@shmup> well in rat scenario it was starting and i could situate myself so only 1 thing could get me.
10:05 <@shmup> but it was.. 5 rats? 1 kobold? then a final rat? or something.
10:05 <@zackoid> yah that's pretty bad.
10:05 < OCTOTROG> shmup (L1 HOFE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
10:05 <@zackoid> if there's something you can do about that i don't know what it is.
10:06 <@shmup> my best chance so far was when i found a spear instantly. then an enchanted dagger i should not have equipped ;)
10:07 <@advil> for a caster start a first priority is to find somewhere where you can pillar dance
10:07 <@zackoid> now that monster-generated weapons are identified i never pick up anything blue off the ground until i have a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> i heard someone else say that recently but i don't get it
10:08 <@shmup> why not hold in inventory?
10:08 <@shmup> it's not like you're gonna hit max inv by time you get a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> well, unlikely
10:09 <@zackoid> i think the early generation is biased toward cursed stuff but i don't know that
10:09 <@zackoid> and 95% of the time by the time i would want any of that i have a decent weapon anyway
10:45 < necKro> we could just add a .. that works like !!
10:45 < necKro> or something
10:46 <@zackoid> are there any . commands that are useful?
10:49 <@advil> I'm not sure what "." means conventionally as opposed to "!"
10:49 <@advil> but some of them could be useful I guess
10:50 <@advil> that is, they don't seem any less useful than the ! ones, just sometimes a bit more special purpose
10:50 <@advil> lots of ones that trigger specific tvs, or find specific kinds of killers, or deaths on particular maps
10:50 <@advil> like johnstein has .hsmap
10:50 <@advil> er
10:50 <@advil> .jsmap
10:51 <@advil> it's the = ones that aren't very useful on their own
11:34 <@shmup> scroll through the list, zackoid .

12:25 <@shmup> you think vehemut, zackoid?
12:27 <@zackoid> depends if you want to hit things with axes or blast
12:30 <@shmup> i only picked up the damn axe cause i thought i wanted a weapon
12:31 <@shmup> i wanna blast. but i did put 6 points in my axe
12:31 <@shmup> which obv it'd need more. shit
12:31 <@shmup> what would you go with if you wanted to axe but still blast a bit. some armour/weapon god? 
12:33 <@zackoid> i usually use ash for that case, but ash is kinda tough if you're not used to blasters 'cause xhe doesn't provide a lot of help early on.  i think vehumet is the easiest way to learn the conj playstyle.
12:33 <@zackoid> axes are just XP hungry relative to other weapons, though the apt might balance that out i'm not sure

10:24 <@zackoid> pfft not even a full-health 1-shot
10:24 <@zackoid> did you drag that up from d:3
10:24 <@zackoid> ?
10:27 <@shmup> yeah. i left it behind and then chose the wrong stairs later.
10:28 <@zackoid> one of the dumbest lessons that took me too long to learn was not to go (immediately) back down the same stairs you just narrowly escaped via
10:28 <@zackoid> also to use X-e
10:28 <@shmup> that's not what happened but that is a good lesson
10:29 <@shmup> i just happened to go back to the same stairs after doing other things
10:29 <@zackoid> yeah i know what you meant, what i'm talking about is much dumber
10:29 <@zackoid> but it is a good idea to drop exclusions for that reason
10:29 <@shmup> ahh. X-e though? sec
10:29 <@shmup> oh i should do that ^
10:30 <@shmup> i def 10000% wanna start doing that actually

10:30 <@shmup> yes..
10:30 <@shmup> damn.
10:44 <@advil> it's a very good idea, especially on a non noisy char
10:45 <@advil> I find that in lair I set 1-4 exclusions per level routinely
10:51 <@zackoid> and then you auto-travel to the edge of your exclusion and wake up a different monster that wakes up the one you excluded.

13:07 <@zackoid> ??energy randomization
13:07 < OCTOTROG> energy randomisation[1/3]: Every time a monster makes a movement (i.e. not an attack/spell), the amount of time taken to do its turn has a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns slower, a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns quicker and a 1/3 chance of being the normal amount. Over time, these 0.1s add up or cancel out to cause 'double moves' or 'lost moves'.
13:07 <@shmup> okay so i went for it on purpose tho cause i was a bit stealthy
13:07 <@shmup> and got up on it and got it to yellow but then

13:08 <@shmup> i was just commenting on speed
13:08 <@zackoid> i think you want to learn conj flame before sticky probs
13:08 <@zackoid> conj flame is really good and much easier to cast
13:09 <@zackoid> also totally forget about stabs
13:09 <@zackoid> try to kill everything at the edge of LoS
13:09 <@zackoid> stab power depends on having stealth and shortblade skill
13:09 <@zackoid> also if an ogre is asleep on D:3 let it sleep.
13:10 <@shmup> oh, all right
13:10 <@shmup> yeah i havent tried conj once yet
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[1/2]: A level 3 spell that creates a cloud of flame in the selected unoccupied space. Many weaker monsters will be unwilling to cross it, but some tougher or less intelligent ones will.
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame[2
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[2/2]: Usage: Fight in corridors. Lure things into corridors. Conjure flame in front of them.
13:10 <@zackoid> the unoccupied place is the most important thing to remember, you have to use it before the monster gets to you
13:10 <@zackoid> but it lets you seal off halways from weak things and blast at your leisure
13:10 <@zackoid> strong things and dumb things will walk right through it, but it does good damage especially if you can trap them in it or chain them
13:24 <@shmup> i don't wanna ever exist in a world where a high elf can't outrun an ogre btw

Always has a cloak. Random colour. Like an ogre, he can deal up to 35 or so damage in one shot. Or paralyse or banish you.

09:43 <@shmup> i'm still uncertain about conjure flame
09:43 <@shmup> i've only tried it a bit, but even an adder won't walk in the damn thing.
09:43 <@advil> uncertain?
09:43 <@shmup> like, not familiar with it
09:43 <@advil> ah
09:43 <@shmup> not sure how dumb is dumb re: mob brains
09:43 <@advil> it's very, very good
09:43 <@zackoid> adder not walking into it is good
09:43 <@shmup> fair
09:44 <@zackoid> only really dumb weak things will walk into it
09:44 <@shmup> so you use it to gain distance AND maybe deal damage if they're super dumb
09:44 <@zackoid> really dumb means mostly zombocoms and skeletons
09:44 <@advil> whether something with brains will walk into it depends on hp, so it's hard to predict
09:44 <@shmup> okay yeah no that does change my viewpoint re distance
09:44 <@zackoid> STRONG things will just not gaf
09:44 <@advil> insects too?
09:44 <@zackoid> though it depends on how much HP they have at the time

09:45 <@advil> maybe not any more
09:45 <@zackoid> ??monster intelligence
09:45 < OCTOTROG> monster intelligence[1/12]: From worst to best: Brainless, Animal, Human. This has many effects on monster behaviour, most notably pursuing you longer, pathfinding better, being more wary of traps/clouds and moving in ways that inconviences you more.
09:45 <@zackoid> there used to be more, right?
09:45 <@advil> yeah
09:46 <@advil> flame cloud is reliable for damaging heavy things, uniques, hydras, that sort of monster
09:46 <@advil> otherwise you use it to trap something while you shoot it or poke at it with a polearm
09:48 <@advil> oh the other thing is that if something's already in a cloud, it will freely walk to more clouds
09:48 <@advil> situationally useful to know
09:49 <@shmup> trying to figure out X-e more.
09:49 <@shmup> by default it fills all rooms visible red, autotravel excluded? but i can press again to just mark single ones (white) and.. those are excluded.. but surrounding is all red still?
09:49 <@zackoid> the 'in another cloud' part is more important with freezing cloud since you can drop that on top of monsters
09:50 <@shmup> i just wanna say "this stair is excluded"
09:50 <@shmup> "stop me if i'm gonna try going up it"
09:50 <@shmup> "or tell me rather"
09:50 <@zackoid> once is LOS from the spot, twice is the spot itself, thrice is clear
09:50 <@shmup> okay well that's what i don't like ^
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a regular spot it changes color
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a stair it does not
09:50 <@shmup> re: spot itself/twice
09:50 <@zackoid> #consoleproblems
09:50 <@shmup> lol
09:51 <@advil> I think technically when you set it on a stair the exclusion is on the other floor
09:51 <@advil> so it'll show there
09:51 <@zackoid> on tiles it works normally
09:51 <@shmup> ty it worked. 
09:51 <@shmup> i mean it yelled at me when trying to go up

09:53 <@zackoid> johnstein: this is wrong, right?
09:53 <@zackoid> https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=21032
09:54 <@zackoid> i've used wizmode on dbro but i thought that was disabled for most people.
09:56 < johnstein> both cbro and dbro compile for wizmode
09:56 < johnstein> on cbro there's dgamelaunch Magic to check if you are a glad
09:56 < johnstein> uh
09:56 < johnstein> if you are a dgladmin
09:57 < johnstein> ie on the admin list. only devs and the occasional other server admin's are on the list and it's a manual process
09:57 < johnstein> so gammafunk can play wizmode on cbro
09:57 < johnstein> and everyone can play wizmode on dbro
09:58 < johnstein> and I'm not sure about the load concern. but I remember someone (some dev?) said there are mild security concerns
09:58 < johnstein> but no one elaborated when I asked for specifics. probably with mildly good reason
09:58 < johnstein> ie not discussing them openly in a chat room with a public searchable log
09:59 < johnstein> I should reply in that thread.  but ugh, Tavern
10:01 <@zackoid> i just thought it odd that a non-admin would talk about using wizmode on CBRO
10:01 < johnstein> oh did I read it wrong?
10:01 < johnstein> he says 8081
10:01 < johnstein> that's dbro
10:01 <@zackoid> ah.
10:01 <@zackoid> i always used dev.
10:02 < johnstein> my snarky reply is, "I can't Believe any lamers aren't using the dev.berotato.org address for dbro"
10:02 <@zackoid> they better not blow up my secret wizmode spot.

13:34 <@zackoid> ah the old double shaft
13:44 <@zackoid> i wonder how hard it would be to have a bot command that fetched the skills, stats, slot a and slot b items from a current dump, launch a crawl instance, fsim weapon a and b, and dump the results back.  everything except returning the results could be done with command line scripting and internal lua i think, though it'd be pretty hacky
13:45 <@zackoid> how hacky depending on if lua can read from arbitrary files.
13:47 <@zackoid> probably the whole thing could be done with pexpect
14:29 <@shmup> what is fsim, zackoid?

14:31 <@zackoid> wizmode fight simulator.  
14:31 <@zackoid> i most use it to compare weapons
14:31 <@zackoid> mostly
14:39 <@zackoid> why is this in the crawl FAQ under 'easy gods for new players': "The most straightforward gods to play are probably Trog or Okawaru (for melee and ranged combat), Vehumet or Sif Muna (for spellcasting), and Yredelemnul (for undead allies). Also, while unreliable, Xom can be a lot of fun."
14:39 <@zackoid> that is an awful answer.
14:40 <@shmup> haha
14:40 <@shmup> indeed
14:45 <@zackoid> even ignoring the xom part, sif is one of the worst gods for a new player and yred, while strong, involves ally management, one of the most frustrating things in crawl.
14:55 <@shmup> what two spelling casting gods would you recommend
14:56 <@zackoid> for a beginner i would not recommend casting at all, and framing it as casting god vs not is problematic anyway.  but if someone was trying to learn how to play a primary-conjurations character i would say vehumet, because vehumet is very straightforward.

14:16 <@shmup> shit zackoid okay so I discovered a thing..
14:16 <@shmup> pr much in this highlighted area: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/fight.cc#L756-L787
14:17 <@shmup> i had to do 5 of those checks for various things, ignoring branding (obv)
14:17 <@shmup> but i wasnt doing the 772-774 shit. it did change my numbers for at least crossbows. need to check others. but.. curious if you can help verify that they're actually right now.
14:19 <@zackoid> i thiiiink short blades and crossbows are the only exceptions to .7 rule
14:19 <@zackoid> outside of unrands
14:20 <@shmup> well if you could peek again whenever
14:20 <@shmup> are you on git or 18
14:20 <@shmup> .18
14:20 <@zackoid> git.
14:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/dcss-weapons.txt
14:20 <@zackoid> next tournament will be around novemberish probably
14:21 <@zackoid> crossbow skill reqs are still wrong on that
14:21 <@zackoid> ??club
14:21 < OCTOTROG> club[1/2]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 5 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay). A heavy piece of wood. Bad.
14:21 <@zackoid> weird.
14:21 <@shmup> man i need to reserve iceland room ASAP i am being a shithead
14:21 <@shmup> you reminded me cause maybe i will be in iceland during the tournament
14:22 <@shmup> hmmmmmmmmm
14:22 <@shmup> @ what you just said
14:22 < odiv> Octopodes are OP
14:22 <@zackoid> odiv: you typed o instead of u
14:22 <@shmup> he was making a joke yo
14:23 <@zackoid> about uctopodes?
14:23 <@shmup> lol
14:23 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc won Op-- s=name,class
14:23 < OCTOTROG> 12 games for @mfc (won Op--): 2x murphyslaw (Artificer, Transmuter), 2x TheNoid (Berserker, Venom Mage), Kramin (Berserker), isthmus (Berserker), kaibutsu (Berserker), valrus (Skald), odiv (Wizard), advil (Ice Elementalist), zackoid (Ice Elementalist), slitherrr (Venom Mage)
14:23 <@zackoid> i'm not using a shield which feels like suicide but i have this amazing arbalest
14:24 < odiv> So at least you'll die feeling like a badass.
14:24 <@zackoid> but i can't afford to train it up so it shoots at 1.5 delay
14:24 <@zackoid> so i feel like i'm making a horrible stategic mistake
14:26 <@shmup> so you're specifically saying my skill required and min delay is wrong
14:26 <@shmup> not the first 3 numbers that require no modification (come straight from source as defined)
14:27 <@shmup> dmg/hit/base-delay that is
14:27 <@zackoid> those look fine yeah
14:27 <@shmup> OK. well. man. how do you know they're wrong btw
14:27 <@shmup> i believe you of course lol
14:28 <@zackoid> it says in game.
14:28 <@shmup> ohh, okay
14:28 <@zackoid> also triple xbows requiring 32 skill was a little suspicious
14:28 <@shmup> yeah heh well i did address that but
14:28 <@zackoid> if you fix the mindelay (it's 1.0) the skill will fix itself
14:28 <@shmup> can you tell me what one of them are btw?
14:28 <@shmup> either for hand or triple
14:28 <@shmup> or whatever i guess heh
14:29 <@zackoid> skill is 10/18 for sure...26 i think for triple
14:29 <@shmup> ok ty
14:34 <@zackoid> i have 8 ring slots and only MR+.
14:37 <@shmup> lol
14:39 <@helicomatic> more games need octopus style imo
14:39 <@helicomatic> that actually made me real mad in diablo when I was a kid, you have 10 fingers but 2 rings
14:41 <@shmup> i wanna see the wiki list of games that let's you wear a ring on every finger

14:59 <@helicomatic> live by the crossbow, die by the crossbow
15:00 <@zackoid> The vault warden hits you from afar with a vampiric glaive!!!
15:00 <@zackoid> was the bigger issue.
15:00 <@helicomatic> ah
15:00 <@helicomatic> those are long
15:03 <@shmup> dang
15:06 <@zackoid> i think that situation might have been literally unsurvivable once the convoker fired.  maybe an immediate double blink before even taking damage, but even that would have been iffy.

12:45 <@zackoid> are you ughing both?
12:45 < odiv> I need to get back into this.
12:45 < odiv> instead of just at tournament time
12:46 <@shmup> no you don't
12:46 <@shmup> do you feel like playing right now
13:26 < advil> the TrHu is at least novel, but DgAr is one of those rolls that makes you not want to play by hyper rules
13:28 <@zackoid> do the rules exclude 'accidently' taking one step too many with an adder in LoS?

14:13 <@zackoid> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/a75ee9761a89626fe171cf83823357b1ab0daba3
14:13 <@zackoid> that one is pretty big.
14:13 < advil> that pakellas wrath went on forever?
14:13 <@zackoid> yeah.
14:13 <@zackoid> so you never had MP regen again
14:16 < advil> that stair change is interesting
14:17 < advil> I'm pretty sure I have chars that would have been alive if that change were in place
14:18 <@zackoid> white very ugly thing vs tengu?
14:19 <@zackoid> i don't intuitively grasp the difference in the speed, but i guess it might mean that a very faster monster might attack you at the top of the stairs before you can act again now?
14:19 < advil> why yes, I'm glad you remember my painful deaths too :-P
14:19 < advil> yeah seems that way...maybe a slight nerf to ac chars
14:20 <@zackoid> it helps to distribute all the built up salt i have from my last game
14:21 < advil> haha
14:21 < advil> is that the optm I saw in the backlog?
14:22 <@zackoid> yeah, though it was more a combination of losing 6 previously to that, all to fast monsters i had no way of dealing with at xl10.  so i finally broke through that wall and had two runes and then died in two turns.
14:23 <@zackoid> MR+ and 6AC is not a solid combination in vaults.  without stoneskin existing you're really dependent on finding statue form i think.
14:26 <@zackoid> the real, deep-down problem is that for some dumb reason i really like form changers but the best form changer races are extremely frail (fe, op, dr is ok).  and there's no guarantee you'll actually get the useful forms.
14:34 < advil> I've never really gotten in to form changers for some reason
14:35 < advil> my one really strong one had such good unarmed it was unnecessary to actually change forms
14:35 <@zackoid> anything that can wear body armour is probably better off just using BH.  and only then if they don't have claws.
14:36 < advil> even blade hands didn't really seem worth it on that char
14:38 <@zackoid> was it a naga of chei?
14:38 < advil> yep

14:39 <@zackoid> chei worshippers hit hard enough that they already do a lot of overkill
14:40 <@zackoid> my naga of chei used blade hands 191 times.  whereas a mftm of ash used it 757 times.
14:44 < advil> I used it all of 64 times
14:47 < advil> it doesn't help that I kind of like the aesthetic of punching orbs of fire to death

16:53 < odiv> that's a good q
17:08 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil the Charlatan (L2 DgAr), slain by a goblin (a +0 club) (led by Robin) on D:2, with 31 points after 1415 turns and 0:06:26. [cbro+]
17:09 < advil> robin with a wand of slowing is tougher than regular robin
17:09 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L1 DsWn) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
17:10 <@zackoid> hyperezmode
17:10 <@zackoid> advil: i recommend uskayaw.
17:10 < advil> it's a pretty lame wn start
17:10 < advil> a +2 short sword and 2 curing potions
17:10 <@zackoid> mine was 4.0 summoning skill with 2 necro spells.
17:10 < advil> I think all my other wanderer successes have had books
17:11 <@zackoid> 2 curing is pretty dang powerful though
17:12 < advil> hm I have 2 hexes
17:14 <@zackoid> which reminds me
17:14 <@zackoid> !!oneandwon
17:14 < OCTOTROG> Chars won first try for zackoid: KoAK, HOVM, HuIE, HOMo, TeAE, MiAr, OgFi, DrWz, DsBe, CeNe, GhFi, DsWn, FoAK, HEIE
17:16 < advil> did 0 skill throwing get slightly better again?
17:16 < advil> rocks are doing more damage than I expect
17:30 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) killed the ghost of Stef the Magician, an amateur DEIE of Nemelex Xobeh. (D:4) [cbro+]
17:31 < advil> for once, guardian comes through
17:33 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) killed Natasha. (D:3) [cbro+]
17:34 < advil> ??uskayaw
17:34 < OCTOTROG> uskayaw[1/5]: God of ecstatic dance. Piety raises very quickly as you deal damage and drops very quickly over time. *: Stomp for AOE damage. **: Teleport through a line of creatures, confusing them. ***: on reaching this piety level, briefly paralyze all enemies in LOS. ****: On reaching this piety level, monsters share damage. *****: Telefrag any monster in LOS.
17:35 <@zackoid> advil: i think it's only the DPS that changed
17:35 <@zackoid> i'm really interested in trying uskayaw in a zig
17:35 <@zackoid> but i'm not interested in getting there, because i hate extended.
17:35 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) became a worshipper of Uskayaw. (D:3) [cbro+]
17:36 < advil> I doubt this one will make it that far
17:36 < advil> having fairly bad luck
17:36 <@zackoid> i only suggested it because i just did a dswn of uskayaw as my last win
17:36 < advil> well, I haven't tried uskayaw
17:37 < advil> and it's the 3rd altar I've found
17:37 <@zackoid> but ds is way hardiers than any of the other species i tried with usk.  i picked it mostly because i wanted to see how it'd be with something stronk, but i didn't want to do mi
17:37 < advil> usk is invocations?
17:37 < advil> seems like I can train it now
17:37 < advil> ???uskayaw
17:37 < OCTOTROG> God of ecstatic dance. Piety raises very quickly as you deal damage and drops very quickly over time. *: Stomp for AOE damage. **: Teleport through a line of creatures, confusing them. ***: on reaching this piety level, briefly paralyze all enemies in LOS. ****: On reaching this piety level, monsters share damage. *****: Telefrag any monster in LOS. / *: Stomp. **: Line Pass. *****:
17:37 < OCTOTROG> Grand Finale. Upon reaching ***, briefly and irresistably paralyze all monsters in LOS. Upon reaching ****, pain bond all monsters in LOS. The *** and **** powers can be triggered once per 30 turns. All powers scale heavily w/ Invo. / reasons <namelastname112> The balrug is hit by a flying piece of Cerebov! /

17:37 <@zackoid> yeah
17:38 < advil> what invoc do I want?
17:38 <@zackoid> it scales up pretty heavily at first, but i'm not sure where the dimishing returns are
17:38 <@zackoid> the more the better, especially with Ds apt
17:38 < advil> yeah, I always forget about that aptitude
17:38 < advil> how does usk interact with allies?
17:38 < advil> should have asked that first
17:39 < advil> I have guardian
17:39 <@zackoid> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue//zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20160809-024758.txt
17:39 <@zackoid> i actually ended up all the way at 26, but the 15 is more indicative probably
17:39 <@zackoid> interact how?
17:40 <@zackoid> i don't know if their damage contributes to piety
17:40 < advil> do they block these moving around abilities?
17:40 <@zackoid> i don't recall
17:40 <@zackoid> i think you can add them to the confuse chain and i don't think he cares
17:41 <@zackoid> but i only had undead allies in that game
17:41 < advil> is any weapon school better than others with usk?
17:42 <@zackoid> i did long blades because he gives two types of stab opportunities, so i trained short blades early and long blades when i found them.  eventually i rarely switched, but in the midgame it can be helpful to get the stabs
17:42 <@zackoid> axes help build piety faster
17:42 <@zackoid> faith is REALLY good
17:42 <@zackoid> the early-mid game is all about getting above the damage curve, but once you are it's really fun
17:43 < advil> I was aiming for long blades since I still don't have a new longblade win, but I haven't exactly found one
17:44 < advil> though there's a randart long sword in a shop
17:44 <@zackoid> any book (or wn) start you are usually using shortblades for a long time anyway

17:45 <@zackoid> heh, 17 feels like ancient history with how many of those spells have been removed
17:47 <@zackoid> what do you think is actually a required zig kit?
17:49 < advil> I'm not sure I have a general answer
17:49 < advil> I went in the first time with only some of that stuff and it wasn't enough, for a DE caster
17:50 < advil> iirc  I didn't have firestorm or necromutation the first time
17:50 <@zackoid> well a level 9 spell and channeling and either MP or HP on kills seems to be popular
17:50 < advil> I got a really bad mummy floor and only survived via fog
17:50 < advil> oh yeah I didn't have the cboe online the first time either
17:50 < advil> just vehumet isn't really enough

17:54 < advil> for boolean disjunction use (( p || q ))
17:54 <@zackoid> it's so hard to read zig logs because everything is clumped in 27

17:58 <@zackoid> both on mummy levels
18:00 <@zackoid> that's the problem with zigs
18:00 <@zackoid> though i guess in this case it's megazigs.  but still gozag->TSO just to grind to the point where you can start.
18:01 < advil> zombies show damage now?
18:02 <@zackoid> yeah.
18:02 <@zackoid> and also heal maybe?
18:03 < advil> the +8 long sword of Undoing {slice, MR- Str+4 Int+4}
18:03 < advil> pity about that MR
18:04 <@zackoid> that's pretty good until after lair

18:05 < OCTOTROG> vehumet wrath[1/3]: ABANDONMENT: 25 penance. RETRIBUTION: HD = your XL. Spell level = 1 + random_range(XL/5,XL/3) capped at 9. Spells include fire storm/hellfire at 9, LCS at 8, poison arrow/iron shot at 6. XL27? Expect 3d20 hellfire, 8d20 fire storm and 3d48 LCS. All of which ignore your EV/SH.
18:05 <@zackoid> that doesn't sound very friendly.
18:06 < advil> he is the god of magical destruction after all
18:06 < advil> when do I use usk stuff?
18:06 < advil> whenever I can?
18:06 <@zackoid> yeah, you'll go from full piety to 1 star in 5 steps if you're not fighting
18:07 < advil> phew, not monstrous
18:07 <@zackoid> depends on the situation.  early on i usually line pass as soon as i hit **
18:07 <@zackoid> because i need everythig i can get
18:07 <@zackoid> later you can let it go to pain bond or the nuke when needed
18:08 <@zackoid> the biggest problem i had in all my games was building piety when my only damage source was a dagger or short sword of venom
18:08 <@zackoid> so the long sword should smooth that out a lot
18:08 < advil> heh
18:08 < advil> what about stomp?
18:08 <@zackoid> they nerfed poison damage piety gain hard because people were abusing it
18:08 <@zackoid> i only use stomp to finish off weak things mostly
18:09 <@zackoid> rarely it'll do enough damage to make up for the piety cost but not often and i'm guessing never at low invoke
18:10 <@zackoid> *** and **** are crazy strong at higher invoke
18:12 <@zackoid> i think i saw that demonic guardian got buffed recently
18:12 < advil> oh really?
18:12 < advil> it seems very good, but I haven't had it in like 4 years
18:12 < advil> so I'm probably a lot better at using it than I would have been
18:13 <@zackoid> i think it was just like shadow imps instead of crimson
18:13 <@zackoid> but six furies are now 3's also, i don't know if that matters

18:15 <@zackoid> you are playng this all wrong
18:15 <@zackoid> uskayaw is the god of bad decisions
18:16 <@zackoid> you're supposed to run up to mobs and punch them in the nose and then go over and punch their friends in the nose too
18:16 <@zackoid> maybe not d:7 ugly things tho
18:16 < advil> heh
18:16 < advil> now I'm standing next to an ugly thing at xl 8, does that count?
18:17 <@zackoid>  that's better.
18:17 < advil> haha yeah that was all fairly unwise
18:18 <@zackoid> not if you're generating piety quickly
18:18 <@zackoid> fyi the paralyzation is something like max 4 turns
18:18 <@zackoid> at higher invoke
18:18 < advil> well I don't think the line pass was a good move, I should have figured there were other red monsters over there
18:19 <@zackoid> the theme song to this run is shut up and dance

22:47 < advil> does uskayaw work well enough at vaults 5 to rely on his powers?
22:57 <@zackoid> i was waiting for a teleport at that point.  i left the stairs via line pass to get the warden because the rhythm got me, knowing it was a terrible idea
22:58 <@zackoid> i wrecked the welcoming commitee but, at least with my defenses, you can't put out enough damage to take out THAT mass safely

11:51 <@zackoid> whoa: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/e213fbe9c8345be16549d0715d7deb1c3d1282dc
11:52 <@zackoid> not that it wasn't obvious immediately that this would happen.
12:02 < odiv> !!polytheist odiv
12:02 < OCTOTROG> Unwon gods for odiv: Elyvilon, Fedhas, Gozag, Hepliaklqana, Qazlal, Sif Muna, Ukayaw, Uskayaw, Xom, Yredelemnul, Zin
12:02 < odiv> Well, I got my pak win.
12:02 < advil> pak probably doesn't count for polytheist right now
12:04 < odiv> oh, that's true
12:04 < odiv> I think I did get a pak win though.
12:05 < odiv> !hs odiv god=pakellas
12:05 < OCTOTROG> 2. odiv the Grand Gadgeteer (L27 GhAr of Pakellas), escaped with the Orb and 5 runes on 2016-05-20 03:16:40, with 2522096 points after 102883 turns and 9:47:21.
12:05 < odiv> is that how you do it?
12:05 < odiv> oh man, I forgot I had that win
12:05 < odiv> !greatplayer
12:05 < OCTOTROG> Unwon species for odiv: Felid, Formicid, Mummy, Ogre, Spriggan, Tengu
12:06 < odiv> those last three souldn't be too hard.
12:06 < advil> only 2 really hard ones left!
12:06 < odiv> formicid gives me the willies, but you're probably right.
12:07 < advil> just imagine using a bardiche with a large shield
12:07 < odiv> mmm
12:07 < odiv> can they still use 2h launchers and shields?
12:07 < advil> !hs . fo -log
12:07 < OCTOTROG> 16. advil, XL27 FoAK, T:125132: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/advil/morgue-advil-20150615-215520.txt
12:07 < advil> yeah, I was using arbalests too
12:17 < odiv> sweet
12:19 <@zackoid> Fo is probably the easiest on that list
12:20 <@zackoid> at least in terms of win%
12:20 < odiv> I might try that next
12:20 < odiv> !greaterplayer
12:20 < OCTOTROG> Unwon backgrounds for odiv: Arcane Marksman, Skald, Summoner, Venom Mage, Warper
12:20 < odiv> FoAM?
12:20 < odiv> or Sk maybe?
12:20 <@zackoid> --AK is the traditional combo.  all those backgrounds are pretty bad.
12:21 <@zackoid> AM and VM are 'recommended' for Fo
12:22 <@zackoid> wait finesse works on formicids now?
12:25 <@zackoid> !!lg @mgf Fo-- won s=class
12:26 < OCTOTROG> No games for @mgf (Fo-- won).
12:26 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc Fo-- won s=class
12:26 < OCTOTROG> 10 games for @mfc (Fo-- won): 4x Abyssal Knight, 3x Fighter, 2x Artificer, Healer
12:27 < advil> I think Sp is the easiest thing on that list
12:28 <@zackoid> i do not query this as proof against that assertion:

12:31 <@zackoid> heh, things i learn from that chart: centaurs are mostly played by thenoid.  octopodes are unreasonably popular.  nobody likes halflings or ghouls.
12:32 < advil> probably that chart is skewed by challenges as much as anything
12:32 < odiv> I like halflings :)
12:32 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc Ha-- s=name
12:32 < OCTOTROG> 539 games for @mfc (Ha--): 53x kagredon, 51x valrus, 48x ZombieSheep, 36x zackoid, 35x porpoise, 35x odiv, 34x tkappleton, 27x murphyslaw, 25x keeo, 21x sleevener, 21x omnomnOMINOUS, 19x demiurge, 19x Kramin, 18x isthmus, 12x 256, 11x apoch, 8x zeidrich, 8x advil, 6x Hildebrand, 5x TheNoid, 4x laceratedsky, 4x necKro23, 4x ces, 4x slitherrr, 4x Gami, 4x Greynaab, 3x RogerD, 3x

12:33 <@zackoid> ghoul was even a challenge!  except i won that one which is pretty good evidence that nobody participated in it.
12:33 <@zackoid> re: spriggan vs formicid, spriggan are probably 'stronger' but they have that whoops-you're-dead aspect that i think makes it hard to recommend them as such
12:34 < advil> !lg goodplayers fo|sp s=crace / won
12:34 < OCTOTROG> 2187/90641 games for goodplayers (fo || sp): 1300/56777x Spriggan [2.29%], 887/33864x Formicid [2.62%]
12:35 <@zackoid> i would guess relative god choice explains not only that difference but flips it

12:36 < advil> interesting
12:37 < advil> not that that restriction is necessarily still meaningful, it's just looking at accounts that now meet those constraints

12:39 <@zackoid> i was not expecting AK to lead by that much for spriggan.
12:39 <@zackoid> is that people doing abyss dive stunts?
12:39 < advil> AK is popular for Sp

13:28 <@zackoid> also did you guys see that crawl has finally entered it's final, purest form?
13:28 <@zackoid> https://github.com/Dracunos/gnollcrawl
13:38 < odiv> AK gives good escape options and also corruption is (was?) pretty sweet for disrupting branch ends and sneaking out with the rune.
13:38 < odiv> only gnolls?
13:38 <@zackoid> plus AK has an MR-checking instakill.
13:38 < odiv> oooh, right, yeah
13:38 <@zackoid> odiv: dungeon crawl: gnoll soup.
13:39 <@zackoid> http://imgur.com/hH1ddlv
13:40 < odiv> battleaxe should be called gnollslayer.
13:40 <@zackoid> looks like he added fake_lang gnoll to replace butt
14:10 < advil> did corruption change?  it should still be good
14:11 <@zackoid> not that i know of.
14:12 < advil> corrupting vaults 5 is fun
14:12 < advil> also, being able to freely wield distortion weapons (and make one) is great
14:31 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L10 DsWn) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:8) [cbro+]
14:35 < advil> heh a green rat pack gets me enough piety to telefrag apparently
14:39 < advil> line pass is pretty good
14:39 <@shmup> !gamesby hyperadvil
14:40 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil has played 15 games, between 2014-09-18 18:00:22 and 2016-08-16 21:08:46, won 1 (6.7%), high score 1421695, total score 1542364, total turns 200781, play-time/day 0:01:30, total time 17:34:45.
14:43 <@zackoid> it's the best active ability of the 3 for sure
14:43 <@zackoid> telefrag i found to be rarely useful
14:43 < advil> seems like it's good for style points in extended
14:43 <@zackoid> it costs all your piety, moves you out of position and rarely are you fighting something dangerous enough to warrant it and enough popcorn to build all that piety at the same time
14:45 <@zackoid> it's great when it works though
14:45 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L10 DsWn) entered a volcano. (Lair:2) [cbro+]
14:48 < advil> riposte is noticeably better with a high + weapon than the last time I tried it
14:51 < advil> I wonder if I get piety from riposting?
14:51 <@zackoid> no idea, but i think the default assumption is that you would
14:56 < advil> no idea what ranged to go for on this char
14:56 < advil> I guess given my starting int of 22 it should be spells
14:57 < advil> not convinced that's a great idea though
15:10 <@zackoid> who needs ranged when you have zoom zoom
15:12 < advil> it's not a priority
15:12 < advil> but I do usually train at least throwing or evoc on combat characters these days
15:12 <@zackoid> i imagine you won't have 22 int by the time you care about it.
15:13 <@zackoid> yeah i had an iron rod, but i barely used it
15:13 < advil> er, where will my int go?
15:13 <@zackoid> line pass does let you get to things in the back fairly reliably
15:13 < advil> I also have a +7 int armour
15:13 <@zackoid> isn't 7 of it from a crappy leather armour?
15:13 < advil> no, it's 22 without that
15:13 <@zackoid> oh, you're not wearing that.
15:13 < advil> 29 with that
15:14 < advil> it's Wn random stats
15:14 <@zackoid> right, just misread
15:15 <@zackoid> seemed like a normal amount with the +7 included, but there's also 14 other +stat items
15:16 <@zackoid> i often feel like there's never enough XP for everything i want to skill, but then i see things like http://pastebin.com/AgYA69gy
15:16 <@zackoid> 24 in 3 defensive skills, puls 18 xbows, plus 16 weapon, plus 18 evoke
15:17 <@zackoid> and then 19 earth magic, with only sandblast memorized.
15:19 < advil> the earth magic is a nice touch
15:20 < advil> oh I guess I do have some +s on ring/sword

18:12 < odiv> hm
18:12 < odiv> what to acquire
18:12 < odiv> the age old quesiton
18:18 <@zackoid> ??rod acquirement
18:18 < OCTOTROG> staff acquirement[2/2]: If your Evocations is greater than (1d(sum of casting skills) - 4), you get a random rod with an 80% chance. Otherwise, you have a 50% chance to get the enhancer for your best skill if you haven't seen it (if you have, you have a flat 1/3 chance for any staff). Otherwise, you get wizardry, energy, or power, with the first two being twice as likely.
18:18 <@zackoid> i thought they moved rods out of staves
18:18 < odiv> I'll probably just go armour
18:19 <@zackoid> i think the 'right' answer is always wands unless you have haste+hw+tele, boringly
18:19 <@zackoid> ??misc acquirement
18:19 < OCTOTROG> 1/1. https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/acquire.cc#L664
18:19 <@zackoid> with trog i think book acquirement is a guaranteed manual
18:20 <@zackoid> guess i was wrong about rods
18:24 <@zackoid> nope, i was right.
18:24 < odiv> The water nymph is enraged by your magic-hating god!
18:24 < odiv> ha
18:24 <@zackoid>         if (class_wanted == OBJ_MISCELLANY && you.species != SP_FELID)

18:26 <@zackoid> ...ew.
18:27 < odiv> ratskin cloak
18:27 < odiv> :/
18:27 < odiv> I already have an rpois ring
18:27 <@zackoid> that's pretty good for an acquirement
18:27 < odiv> with rC+
18:27 <@zackoid> unless you have a really good cloak
18:27 < odiv> yeah, no it's still worht using
18:27 <@zackoid> not having to swap for rpois is nice.
18:28 < odiv> I lose almost 10% of my AC!
18:28 < odiv> heh

19:12 <@zackoid> i think i quit that one because i was salty that i never found portal projectile and now i have to get a 3rd rune without it
19:14 <@zackoid> huh:  D - the ring "Agalen" {Wiz *Confuse +Inv Str+8}

21:59 < odiv> zackoid: Not very until it kills you? :P
22:00 < odiv> I guess it depends how much confusion would screw you over.
22:00 < odiv> I generally just avoid all those brands
22:00 < odiv> which either means I'm too risk adverse or it's bad design
22:02 <@zackoid> contam isn't bad at all if you have EV
22:03 < odiv> ?
22:03 < odiv> contam/drain is on unequip, isn't it?
22:03 < odiv> or did that change? I haven't been around in a while.

14:44 < odiv> +8AC
14:44 < odiv> and +5 with a ring.

17:48 < advil> that one can go poorly
17:52 < odiv> Yeah, I'm pretty squishy
17:52 < odiv> I shouldn't even be in elf really.
17:53 < odiv> but ever since vaults requires a rune it's tough
17:57 < odiv> so...
17:57 < odiv> hm
17:57 < odiv> what to do
17:57 < odiv> hurl damnation sounds painful, frankly.
17:57 < advil> I had it on a Ds recently and barely used it
17:58 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L18 DsEE) was cast into the Abyss! (a deep elf demonologist) (WizLab) [cbro]

18:01 < odiv> ooh
18:02 < odiv> I did it!
18:02 < odiv> whee
18:04 < odiv> should I use that staff?
18:04 < odiv> It sounds like it hurts.
18:05 < zackoid> i'm not sure what the point of that item is
18:06 < zackoid> if you rely on conjurations it does way too much damage
18:07 < odiv> and you can't swap it, yeah
18:07 < zackoid> it'd be great on VpEn maybe?
18:08 < odiv> eh
18:08 < zackoid> actually now i really want it on a vpen
18:08 < odiv> I guess yeah
18:08 < odiv> but no healing
18:08 < zackoid> no healing?
18:08 < odiv> when you're bloodless
18:09 < zackoid> vamp heals when you're bloodless iirc
18:09 < odiv> oh sure, I was thinking you'd switch away for melee
18:09 < zackoid> but you don't need to be bloodless anyway
18:14 < odiv>  You drop the +3 pair of gloves of Makhleb's Displeasure {-Tele rPois Dex+4
18:14 < odiv> _Stlth+}.
18:14 < odiv> more like odiv's displeasure

22:58 < odiv> probably switch out of this armour at some point to robes.
22:58 < odiv> So I can shatter all the things.
23:04 < zackoid> you have 3 unidentified scrolls
23:04 < zackoid> !
23:04 < odiv> Yeah?
23:04 < odiv> summoning, torment, holy?
23:04 < odiv> or um, I forget hte other one
23:05 < odiv> silence
23:05 < zackoid> just use the ID scrolls on them
23:05 < odiv> nah
23:05 < zackoid> at least for summoning
23:05 < odiv> I have that one inscribed
23:05 < odiv> at least I think it's that.
23:05 < odiv> Maybe it's torment. :P
23:06 < zackoid> those defenses are...something.  especially considering a weapon of protection and a +5AC ring.  but such is the odiv of vehumet way.
23:06 < odiv> What do you mean somthing?
23:06 < odiv> like bad?
23:06 < odiv> also, weapon's not equipped rn
23:06 < zackoid> oh not wielding the trident, nm
23:06 < zackoid> yeah.
23:06 < zackoid> and yeah, bad.
23:06 < odiv> eh, they seem fine?
23:06 < zackoid> 8 dodging skill at xl21???
23:06 < odiv> +8 AC from scales
23:07 < odiv> You know what the best defense is?
23:07 < odiv> :D
23:07 < zackoid> yeah AC isn't terrible thanks to rings and mutations
23:07 < zackoid> but 15 dodging would be practically free at this point.  and 160HP is not good for a Ds
23:08 < zackoid> is there some nasty unique in spider?
23:08 < odiv> Ghost moths
23:08 < odiv> I have no SINv
23:08 < odiv> I should check again.
23:08 < odiv> but I don't think I've found any
23:08 < zackoid> stucky flame?
23:08 < odiv> Seems like I have barely any jewellery actually
23:08 < odiv> Yeah, I have that
23:09 < odiv> but that only works when they're right up on me
23:09 < odiv> and they drain MP from a distance
23:09 < zackoid> 5 pots of invis
23:09 < odiv> yeah, true
23:09 < odiv> It's been a while since I've been there.
23:09 < odiv> and I just finished vaults to 4
23:09 < odiv> So it's depths and Spider
23:10 < zackoid> no MR items at all?
23:11 < odiv> not that I could see
23:11 < odiv> I searched for magic and MR
23:11 < odiv> this robe I'm carrying could be

00:07 < odiv> reluctantly. :P
00:07 < odiv> even though I'm farther away from shatter.
00:08 < odiv> Did find a wizardry ring.
00:11 < odiv> still kinda lacking in gear
00:21 < zackoid> i've never cast shatter.
00:21 < zackoid> level 9 spells are not very useful in a <6 rune game, though i have cast all the rest i think
00:22 < odiv> Orrrr, you speed to the 9 spell and wreck zot with it. :P
00:52 < zackoid> does shatter work vs OOFs?
00:53 < odiv> they're flying, so not very well
00:53 < odiv> iron shot
00:53 < odiv> It takes down draconian packs realy well
00:53 < odiv> and liches, etc
00:53 < odiv> Just walk into a room, shatter 2-3 times.
00:53 < odiv> drop mic

13:49 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[1/5]: Assuming you aren't monstrous, you get five facets, each consisting of three mutations (which usually just stack together). You will get one scales-type facet, one body-slot facet, two tier 2 facets, and one tier 3 facet. 
13:49 < odiv> ???ds mutation rules
13:49 < OCTOTROG> Assuming you aren't monstrous, you get five facets, each consisting of three mutations (which usually just stack together). You will get one scales-type facet, one body-slot facet, two tier 2 facets, and one tier 3 facet.  / The {scales}-type facets are icy blue, iridescent, molten, rough black, rugged brown, slimy green, thin metallic, or yellow scales, or alternatively thin skeletal
13:49 < OCTOTROG> structure, large bone plates, or a repulsion field. Body-slot facets: claws, horns, antennae, hooves, talons. / Tier 2 facets: powered by death, powered by pain, demonic guardian, nightstalker, spiny, rot (rRot, foul stench), fire (flame cloud immunity, rF+, ignite blood), ice (freezing cloud immunity, rC+, icemail), magic shield. / Tier 3 facets: robust (+30% HP), negative energy
13:49 < OCTOTROG> (rN+/rTorment/black mark), {augmentation} (+slay/spellpower scaling with HP), ice (rC+, freezing cloud immunity, passive freeze), fire (rF+, flame cloud immunity, hellfire). Ice/fire facets are incompatible, as are foul stench/ignite blood. / If you are monstrous (1 in 10 chance), then you get 3 body-slot facets but you don't get scales. You still get 2 tier 2 facets and 1 tier 3
13:49 < OCTOTROG> facet, for 6 facets total. Your first body slot mutation will come with the message, "You feel monstrous as your demonic heritage exerts itself."

13:50 < odiv> ??black mark
13:50 < OCTOTROG> black mark[1/2]: Demonspawn mutation gained at level 3 of the negative energy facet. Gives melee attacks that deal damage a 1/5 chance of applying antimagic, weakness or draining to the target. 
13:50 < odiv> ooh
13:50 < odiv> ??black mark[2
13:50 < OCTOTROG> black mark[2/2]: Also a monster spell, from {black sun}s and {Murray}. Any allies in LOS as well as the caster begin absorbing vital energies, and any melee done will, with no rN check, heal said individuals as well as either drain XP, speed, or mp. (This has an antimagic, slowing, or HD drain effect on other monsters). Not that dangerous without the right ally.

16:40 < OCTOTROG> majin-bo[1/3]: +6 Majin-Bo {vamp, Archmagi, MP+6 Int+6}. It's a quarterstaff! Acts as a universal spell enhancer, but costs HP every time you cast a spell: 1 HP per MP spent. (This will never kill you, directly.)

17:03 < odiv> ??rtorment
17:03 < OCTOTROG> torment resistance[1/1]: Each level of rN reduces torment's damage by 10%, so at rN+++ you'll only lose 35% of your HP. In addition, demonspawn can get a torment resistance mutation (50% chance of 0 damage), Kiku gives torment resistance (average protection 60%) at high piety, and Statue Form or being a gargoyle reduces torment damage by half.

17:59 < odiv> two lost souls showed up
18:07 < zackoid> that sounds like a bug
18:07 < zackoid> ??lost soul
18:07 < OCTOTROG> lost soul[1/2]: A crypt monster which tries to stay away from you. If a non-zombie undead dies in its LOS, the lost soul will die instead (fully healing the undead). If a living creature dies, it will become a undead (unrevivable) version of that creature. If other enemies are around, will sometimes ignore the death of low HD creatures.

20:57 < odiv> ah
20:57 < odiv> this is regen, I think, right?
21:02 < zackoid> that makes sense.
21:08 < odiv> anyway, that amulet is awesome

23:23 < odiv> ???shatter
23:23 < OCTOTROG> Level 9 earth spell. Extremely powerful attack which does damage comparable to LCS to all non-flying non-amorphous monsters in LOS radius. Doesn't damage stuff on the other side of walls, but conveniently destroys nearby walls (and potions in 0.13 and earlier) anyway. Prior to 0.15, had a range of (3 + Earth/5). / Deals 1/3x damage to flying and amorphous monsters. 2x damage to
23:23 < OCTOTROG> petrifying, skeletal and brittle monsters (stuff that can be LRD'd, mostly), and 1.5x damage  icy monsters. 4x damage to petrified! Note that it doesn't damage insubstantial monsters at all! Also, petrifying has 2/3 and petrified has 1/2 final damage reduction, so it's more like 4/3x / 2x with AC reduction. / !lg ElderVIII xl=27 pan drcj 1 -tv / !lg xuaxua xl=27 grgl place=pan 1

23:25 < odiv> Yeah, just picked it up
23:25 < odiv> bolt is in a book somewhere.
23:25 < odiv> several places
23:26 < zackoid> i think it is possible that every single blaster that i got the slimy rune with had tornado
23:26 < odiv> heh
23:26 < zackoid> which just eats up TRJ and all his summons
23:26 < zackoid> shatterninja?
23:26 < odiv> Yeah, I'm considering it, but it'd take a while.
23:26 < odiv> I'd mostly be going there for loot, so eh
23:26 < odiv> Not that I really need anything specific.
23:27 < zackoid> this guy got it without tornado: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue//zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20160105-030928.txt
23:27 < zackoid> had pretty good melee though.  i don't remember but based on the spell list probably OOD then tele when TRJ bit it
23:27 < odiv> Nice AC!
23:28 < zackoid> gargoyles are like that.
23:28 < odiv> Yeah.
23:28 < odiv> I'll just come back later or never.

23:28 < odiv> er 4
23:28 < zackoid> if you had a penetrating spell i think 2 LCS and then something to penetrate on the retreat would work
23:29 < odiv> I suppose I could do abyss
23:29 < odiv> I should train some stealth
23:29 < odiv> I have magma
23:29 < zackoid> does that penetrate like fire/cold?
23:29 < odiv> it does have shit AC
23:29 < odiv> yep
23:29 < odiv> it's just less resistable for rF+ dudes
23:29 < odiv> and less damage/range
23:30 < zackoid> for some reason i thought it dropped off faster
23:30 < zackoid> ??bolt of magma
23:30 < OCTOTROG> bolt of magma[1/2]: 55% resistible (by rF) L5 Conj/Fire/Earth bolt spell. Range 5. To-hit: 8+power/25.
23:30 < zackoid> ??bolt of magma[2
23:30 < OCTOTROG> bolt of magma[2/2]: Most likely does more damage than force lance.
23:30 < zackoid> haha
23:31 < odiv> ???bolt of fire
23:31 < OCTOTROG> A level 6 conj/fire penetrating beam attack that can hit multiple opponents in a line for pure fire damage. Does six dice with a maximum of (18 + (power * 2) / 3). At power 50 it does 6d8 damage; at power 100 it does 6d14. As with any fire-based beams, produces steam if it passes over water. To-hit: 10+power/25.

23:31 < odiv> but I have 0 skills in ice. :P

23:32 < odiv> I thought I had a bunch, but that was my last character.

23:36 < odiv> not carts
23:36 < zackoid> iirc i found a staff of power on D:2
23:36 < odiv> nice
23:36 < zackoid> i think the xl25+ magic darts were just to pull stuff
23:36 < odiv> energy is only making a couple things hungerless for me now
23:36 < zackoid> since it's max range, and without vehumet not many spells are
23:36 < odiv> Maybe I should go pick up power again.
23:36 < odiv> or keep my AC dtrident equipped
23:36 < zackoid> power is swappable now, you just lose the bonus
23:37 < odiv> magic dart + battlesphere is a pretty mana efficient way to clear stuff out sometimes.
23:37 < odiv> Yeah, I've been swapping it.
23:37 < zackoid> well not swappable but didn't it used to have some stupid mechanic?
23:37 < odiv> until I got energy.
23:37 < odiv> don't remember.
23:37 < odiv> it didn't stack well with other MP stuff I think for one

23:46 < zackoid> oh that fo.

23:50 < OCTOTROG> A cat race that can't use armour, weapons, rods, or throw anything. They gain {extra lives} as they level up. They have claws (lvl 1: +2 dam), fangs, and fur.

12:43 < odiv> it sucks when it misses.

12:51 < odiv> I think I like earth better as a support school.

14:30 < odiv> haha
14:30 < odiv> oh god
14:30 < odiv> that would be funny
14:30 < odiv> hexes and xbows maybe
14:30 < odiv> so am wouldn't be terrible.
14:31 < odiv> well here goes nothing
14:31 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L1 FoAM) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
14:36 < zackoid> warper does have apportation and portal projectile and passage of golubria which are all pretty good for Fo
14:36 < odiv> Yeah, true. but it's a challenging start even with blink imo
14:37 < zackoid> yeah it's a bad start.
14:37 < odiv> hm
14:37 < odiv> I should have planned this
14:37 < odiv> just go all str all the way? :)
14:38 < odiv> I don't think I'm going to be much of a caster and heavy armour + big fuckoff axe + shield sounds pretty good to me.
14:38 < odiv> thoughts?
14:48 < odiv> Oops, that ring feels deathly cold.
14:48 < odiv> _o - a cursed ring of teleportation (left hand)

15:30 < odiv> chei!
15:30 < odiv> Identified the +10 great mace of the Madman {crush, *Rage rElec rC+++ Int-2} (You found it on level 4 of the Dungeon)
15:30 < odiv> holy fuck
15:31 < odiv> Yeah, that certainly sets the tone
15:36 < zackoid> i did a lot of fo of chei in linesprint.
15:36 < zackoid> it's fun but obviously not very good for winning a particular game.
15:36 < zackoid> better stop training axes!
15:37 < odiv> hm?
15:37 < odiv> why is that?
15:37 < odiv> oh, yeah, that's not me.
15:37 < zackoid> oh right.
15:37 < odiv> that's from the log above.
15:37 < odiv> I wish
15:37 < odiv> was still using it at the end
15:38 < zackoid> does stasis prevent *rage?
15:39 < odiv> stasis itself did
15:39 < odiv> is fo stasis exactly stasis?
15:39 < odiv> ??stasis
15:40 < OCTOTROG> stasis[1/1]: Blocks teleport, blink, haste, slow, berserk, and paralysis. The amulet (removed in 0.18) will give you some (possibly yellow) {contam} and cancel the status if you put it on while hasted or slowed, or while waiting for teleport. Formicids have this as an intrinsic.
15:40 < odiv> Yeah, awesome
15:40 < odiv> ha
16:57 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L6 FoAM) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:4) [cbro+]
16:58 < odiv> oh right
16:58 < odiv> what god?
16:58 < odiv> zackoid: ping
16:58 < odiv> makhleb seems like a bad choice because tele is important when summoning angry demons
16:59 < odiv> !lg * won FoAM s=god
16:59 < OCTOTROG> 29 games for * (won FoAM): 6x Okawaru, 3x Ashenzari, 3x Gozag, 3x Cheibriados, 2x Fedhas, 2x Makhleb, 2x Ru, 2x Xom, Yredelemnul, The Shining One, Trog, Zin, Nemelex Xobeh, Hepliaklqana
16:59 < odiv> gozag?
16:59 < odiv> ???gozag
16:59 < OCTOTROG> The greedy god of gold. Turns corpses into gold, which gives a distraction status that may cause enemies to lose turns. Lets you use {potion petition}, lets you {call merchant}s, and lets you {bribe branch}es. Does not have a normal piety system. / Joining Gozag costs some gold, based on the amount of gold generated in the game so far. On conversion all abilities are available, as long
16:59 < OCTOTROG> as you have enough gold.  / https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:brainstorm:god:propose:gold / <kroki> actually i wanted to try out the money god <kroki> its shit and boring af <kroki> some dev must really love the god /  <Karasu_> So I guess I have to abandon Gozag or else I'll starve / <mibe> you should be able to cancel [potion petition] by abandoning your religion from
16:59 < odiv> I do need a gozag win
16:59 < OCTOTROG> that screen / <Stendarr> b - [D:5] the cursed +0 robe of Gozag's Brutal Revenge {rC+} (163 gold) <Stendarr> so brutal
17:01 < odiv> ???potion petition
17:01 < OCTOTROG> Lets you buy one of three random lists of potion effects, with price depending on the potions offered. The lists can include most good tactical potions. The price of potions does not increase with each use.
17:01 < odiv> ???call merchant
17:01 < OCTOTROG> Pick a shop from a list of four randomly chosen types, and place the shop at your current location. The merchants never ask for more gold than activating call merchant requires, usually significantly less. The quality of the shop contents is based on your XL. / In 0.17-, the shop is placed in an unexplored D/V:1-4/U floor with no previous shops, and the quality of the shop contents is
17:01 < OCTOTROG> better on deeper levels. You get a message when you enter the floor with the shop and you can also check their location on ctrl-o.
17:01 < zackoid> i think they made finesse work on formicids now?
17:02 < odiv> yeah, I think so.
17:02 < odiv> ???finesse
17:02 < OCTOTROG> Heroism (*) temporarily gives +5 to all non-magic skills except Invocations and Evocations, although Fighting skill from it gives no extra HP. Finesse (*****) halves attack delay but does not stack with haste or berserk. Okawaru also gifts weapons, armour, and ammo.
17:02 < zackoid> * Finesse is no longer blocked by stasis.
17:02 < zackoid> is 0.18

17:02 < OCTOTROG> Unwon gods for odiv: Elyvilon, Fedhas, Gozag, Hepliaklqana, Qazlal, Sif Muna, Ukayaw, Uskayaw, Xom, Yredelemnul, Zin
17:03 < zackoid> yred would help with escapes.
17:03 < odiv> hm
17:03 < odiv> I'd probably want to switch to a bardiche
17:04 < zackoid> i've only done gozag with Mu--.  as long as you don't rely on spells that's probably fine too
17:04 < zackoid> hepl was considered really strong but comes with frail 1 now
17:05 < zackoid> i've only done oka and lugonu with fo
17:06 < odiv> I'm on stable, so no hepl
17:06 < odiv> on the plus side, there's pak. :)
17:06 < zackoid> qaz would probably be a bad idea.
17:07 < zackoid> pak was great, but if you're already investing in crossbows not as much
17:07 < odiv> I have like 4 in xbows

17:09 < odiv> shoot xbows past plants
17:09 < odiv> summon shit to run away
17:09 < zackoid> fedhas is strong
17:09 < zackoid> and annoying imo.
17:10 < odiv> fedhas is decent for 3 runes I think
17:10 < zackoid> considered the best early game god iirc
17:11 < odiv> and I do need fedhas for poly
17:11 < odiv> well, we'll see if he's in this temple
17:12 < odiv> nope
17:12 < odiv> no even oka or gozag

17:20 < zackoid> heh vehumet sticks out a lot
17:20 < odiv> How?
17:20 < zackoid> well you can eliminate TSO and jiyva for being late gods.  pakellas and ru have a recency bias.
17:20 < zackoid> no idea what is up with beogh
17:21 < zackoid> maybe just small sample

17:22 < odiv> since my last two were vehumet and trog?

17:23 < odiv> oh, there it is
17:23 < odiv> next to beogh
17:24 < odiv> it's just not letting me mouse over.
17:24 < zackoid> i thought you had a Dg win?
17:24 < odiv> yeah, it's there next to Beogh
17:25 < odiv> it's just a really low % because I have so many games played where I didn't last long enough for a god.
17:26 < zackoid> 0.12%
17:32 < odiv> yes, I realize I die a lot. :(
17:32 < zackoid> everyone does without a god

18:15 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.

18:58 < odiv> Yeah, I don't think enchant gets rid of cursed anymore?
18:58 < odiv> so that ring and dire flail look pretty good right?
18:58 < odiv> That seems like an endgame quality weapon.
18:59 < odiv> ??great mace
18:59 < OCTOTROG> great mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; -4 acc / 17 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). An enormous metal war club, of great cumbrousness. The largest mace most playable races can wield. Ogres and Trolls can wield giant (spiked) clubs too.

18:59 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.

After 40-50 turns, the passage will disappear (making a snapping noise in the process) so be careful if you were relying on it for escape.

10:36 < OCTOTROG> One game for zackoid (cikiller=the_player_character): a kobold (exploding inner flame (29))
14:17 < odiv> the +12 war axe "Waoss" {chop, MR++}
14:20 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L15 FoAM) killed the ghost of mandarbmax the Brawler, a journeyman TrMo of Ru. (D:13) [cbro+]

14:23 < zackoid> odiv: how is foaming?
14:24 < odiv> too easy right now
14:26  * zackoid knocks on wood.
14:28 < zackoid> i wonder if you should use slings instead of crossbows
14:28 < zackoid> actually i'm pretty sure you should, other than greatslings are 1H.
15:08 < odiv> you think?
15:08 < odiv> seems like a waste, but yeah probably right
15:08 < odiv> I'm just waiting for penetration. Is that still a thing?
15:18 < zackoid> odiv: uh not sure, lots of branded ammo got removed
15:18 < zackoid> since you haven't trained much crossbows and you a great greatsling it probably makes sense to use that
15:18 < zackoid> though it'll still be pretty good untrained i'd guess
15:20 < zackoid> ??penetration brand
15:20 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled penetration_brand in my learndb.
15:24 < odiv> ??penetration
15:24 < OCTOTROG> penetration[1/1]: Missiles fired from a launcher of penetration act like bolt spells and can hit several targets. Not unique to crossbows anymore, as javelins may have this brand as well. Also on {piercer} in 0.14+.
15:24 < odiv> Yeah, it's on the launcher now.
15:25 < odiv> and I've got my +12 fuckin' axe

15:25 < odiv> ran across a topor snail and it didn't slow me down.

15:26 < odiv> getting greatsling up a bit wouldn't really hurt anyway
15:26 < zackoid> i think holding out for a penetration crossbow is probably not likely to pay off
15:26 < odiv> yeah, you're right.
15:26 < zackoid> i have no idea what the probabilites are with oka but they can't be big
15:59 < odiv> seems like I always find one
15:59 < odiv> but maybe way later than would be useful.
16:00 < zackoid> i can't recall the last time i even saw one, but i don't use xbows that much
16:02 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L15 FoAM) killed Gastronok. (Lair:3) [cbro+]
16:05 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Maud. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
16:10 < odiv> +8 arbalest as gift, ooh
16:10 < odiv> but I'm already using punk
16:16 < zackoid> heh sorry
16:17 < odiv> nah, that's not amazing
16:17 < odiv> triple arbalest of penetration would be where it's at.
16:17 < zackoid> i never use triple xbows because 26 skill is nutso
16:20 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) became the Champion of Okawaru. (Lair:8) [cbro+]
16:21 < odiv> such a perfectionist.
17:53 < odiv> 491 gold   the ring "Ryson" {Fragile +Fly rPois Dex+7}
17:53 < odiv> I wonder if I should get that.
17:53 < odiv> probably not
17:56 < zackoid> why not?  do you have a better use for money and/or ring slots currently?
17:57 < zackoid> for 500g i would wear that through lair branches easily
17:57 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Harold. (Orc:1) [cbro+]

18:05 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Nergalle. (Orc:2) [cbro+]
18:07 < odiv> and that's orc done
18:09 < odiv> You finish putting on the +1 pair of gloves of Raukkecuwn {rPois Dex+4}
18:10 < zackoid> especially since you're training dodging too, 7 dex is probably wroth a couple EV with such a low base dex
18:12 < odiv> what str do I need for cpa or ice dragon armour?
18:13 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L17 FoAM) killed Urug. (D:14) [cbro+]
18:13 < zackoid> do you mean or gold dragon armour?
18:14 < zackoid> i think CPA is 25ish.  IDA is only like 12ish
18:14 < odiv> oh cool
18:14 < zackoid> i don't think i've ever actually worn CPA outside of sprint
18:14 < zackoid> ??cpa
18:14 < OCTOTROG> crystal plate armour[1/2]: 14AC, 23ER.
18:15 < odiv> k, thanks
18:15 < zackoid> is the trident for hydras?
18:15 < odiv> I guess I'll start going into dex
18:15 < odiv> Yeah it was
18:15 < zackoid> yeah i never take str once i'm into the low 20's.  though with the changes to strweight there might be benefits, not sure
18:16 < zackoid> i probably put too much importance on balancing AC and EV though
18:16 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L17 FoAM) reached level 15 of the Dungeon. (D:15) [cbro+]
18:16 < odiv> you cannot shaft yourself on this level.

11:24 < zackoid> odiv: tengus are like the most vehumet species possible
11:24 < odiv> I got conj,fire, and ice books

11:25 < zackoid> i'm suprised you haven't won one before because of that
11:25 < odiv> probably go air/fire
11:26 < odiv> I kinda want to start streaming crawl.
11:26 < odiv> I should get better first.
11:26 < odiv> and I would either have to play tiles or just have another window open with tiles that I stream. :P
11:26 < zackoid> i never understand streaming crawl because it's pretty bad for that
11:26 < odiv> is it?
11:26 < zackoid> since you have built in streaming and recording but when you use video it's hard to display in a way that is readable
11:27 < odiv> I guess people can just tune in on the web, yeah.
11:27 < odiv> I wonder if anyone ever tries to chat with me.
11:27 < zackoid> if you are going to video cast you should set up a tiles profile specifically for it and spectate your own games, then stream the spectate
11:27 < zackoid> gammafunk has an rc for it, with bigger font and tiles 
11:27 < odiv> ah
11:28 < zackoid> it's weird that they still haven't made it so tileschat is relayed to the console player
11:34 < odiv> I rember reading it in my log after I'd finished a while ago.
11:34 < odiv> but they don't put it in there any more.
11:35 < zackoid> it's an option

11:47 <@shmup> kinda just stream to stream cause your audience is gonna suck anyways
11:47 < odiv> Oh no, I don't think there's an audience for this.
11:47 <@shmup> yeah
11:47 <@shmup> will you talk to streamers?

09:55 <@shmup> wait I am not thinking clearly..
09:55 <@shmup> shorest win is least # of turns
09:55 <@shmup> fastest win is.. least amount of time?
09:55 <@shmup> isn't time directly a function of turns though?
09:55 <@shmup> in this context
09:56 < zackoid> since they have both fastest and shortest i assume that fastest means purely real time
09:56 < zackoid> and time and turncount aren't really related, no

18:59 < zackoid> was that the long one about the monster difficulty?
18:59 < advil> yeah
19:00 < advil> I'm not sure posting that accomplished much, but it got it out of my head
19:00 < zackoid> i especially enjoyed how the one guy illustrated your point when trying to argue something else.
19:00 < advil> and dpeg liked it?
19:00 < zackoid> i don't mind minmay personally, but his status and the way everyone defers to him totally poisons the culture
19:01 < zackoid> it'd be fine if it was jsut the one person like that, but everyone else mimics it
19:01 < advil> I alternate between finding him annoying and ok
19:02 < apoch> how do I figure out how often I die to sigmund?
19:02 < advil> often when people complain about his attitude directly to him he lightens up for a few posts, at least

19:05 < zackoid> but not all starts are equal.  sometims you find a nice dagger.
19:05 < apoch> I'm happy if I get a rune so I play too subobtimaly to worry about win rate
19:05 < advil> can't remember if the count for lm includes deaths
19:05 < zackoid> i don't care about winrate in itself, but i think roguelikes only work if you try and win every game you start.
19:06 < advil> yeah, winrate is a proxy for that
19:06 < advil> also streaking is fun when it works
19:06 < apoch> I hope to win every game I start, but sigmund early gives me a nice boost.

10:36 < zackoid> is that one of those diplomacyalikes?
10:37 <@shrump> it's a 4x game but with a goal of being a lot simpler mechanically. but, control +50% of the stars in the universe and you win
10:37 <@shrump> it does help if you message other Aliens (players) and try to make some deals. you can trade tech with them, ally, fuck over etc.
10:37 <@shrump> I have never played though. this will be my first game
10:38 <@shrump> it will take a few weeks. you won't spend much time in a day spending cred and pointing carriers to claim new stars
10:38 <@shrump> as it might take 8 hours to reach the star you're heading towards

15:10 < zackoid> advil: i have a dumb historical linguistics question if and or when you are up for it.
16:29 < zackoid> advil: also: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/ff52c9bc7241d78ec84204876d2cae7477738c84
16:33 < neckrobama> zackoid: RIP sacrilege
16:33 < neckrobama> meanwhile in nethack, your own god will kill you if you pray too much
16:38 < zackoid> that makes more sense than your god letting some worthless orc have his way with you.
17:29 < advil> good for marvinpa
17:29 < advil> I can try to answer historical linguistics questions but I'm more of an ahistorical linguist
17:40 < zackoid> yeah i know it's not your deal.
17:41 < zackoid> i was just thinking about how it makes sense that when you're talking about languages that divereged from a common ancestor the words that share roots are ones that date to everyday things from the time before they diverged, but i was wondering if anyone had ever tried to prove that.  though maybe thinking about it again it's a tautology.
17:44 < advil> I think when people do language reconstruction it is often high frequency nouns and verbs that they work with
17:46 < zackoid> and sorta relatedly i also wonder if some words resist change more based on their meaning rather than like their complexity
17:48 < zackoid> weird, there are 3 seperate PIE words that eventually became modern words for water?
17:48 < advil> well, I do know that there are common paths for words to change meaning, e.g. 1. meaning X, 2. metaphorical extension of X to meaning Y (e.g. a spatial word gets extended to also have a sense that refers to time, like "on"), 3. word loses meaning X
17:49 < advil> yeah for  really common everyday objects there are more likely to be multiple words
17:50 < advil> for your first question I think what you want is to look at how people calculate the "lexical similarity" of languages
17:51 < advil> I have no idea what the data or method are but this is a neat graph: https://elms.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/lexical-distance-among-languages-of-europe/
17:52 < advil> aha https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list
17:53 < advil> here's an article with a lot of interesting more modern discussion: http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_peterlang_2013c
17:54 < zackoid> glottochronology is a fun word.
17:54 < zackoid> "The Swadesh list was put together by Morris Swadesh on the basis of his intuitions".  SCIENCE!
17:55 < advil> heh yeah that's why those people in that last link start from scratch
17:56 < zackoid> actual physical distance means nothing on that chart, right?  because at first i was suprised how closely Finnish was to the germanic languages, but based on the dotted line it's not close at all.
17:57 < advil> yeah I guess not...not sure I'm very into the line type = degree convention in use there
17:57 < advil> I retract my claim that it's a neat graph
17:57 < zackoid> haha
17:58 < zackoid> poor greek.
17:59 < advil> they seem to have tried to scale the edge lengths by lexical distance, but perhaps overall position in the chart is not as interpretable
18:00 < zackoid> is there a word for languages like croatian-serbian and urdu-hindi that are mostly seperate for political reasons?
18:02 < zackoid> pluricentric maybe.  i need to back out of this wikihole and go home before it's too late.
18:02 < advil> it's more of a concept or a ling 101 aphorism: "a 'language' is a dialect with an army."
18:05 < zackoid> i apologize that all my questions deal with the degenerate form of your discipline.  i'd ask questions about the cool current stuff if i could understand any of it.
18:07 < advil> that's ok, language change is probably objectively more interesting than what I actually do
18:08 < advil> except insofar as it's not interesting because it's impossible due to lack of data and methods for hypothesis testing
18:09 < advil> if we had time machines I'd work on language change instead

Make three copies of the save: orig, temp, fixed. / 2. Play temp.cs, enter wizmode, and move to the appropriate spot with xm (without spending any turns)  3. &( to create the feature, then save. / 4.
22:19 < OCTOTROG> crawl -edit-save temp.cs -get D:14 d14.chunk   4. crawl -edit-save fixed.cs -put D:14 d14.chunk   5. copy fixed.cs and load the copy to verify that the feature is there and you aren't in wizmode.  6. copy fixed.cs back to the server.

17:51 < advil> yeah yeah
17:51 < advil> but polymorph doesn't
18:59 < zackoid> i only used it once but i would definitely use it again if i had 20 long blades
18:59 < zackoid> the log only has two polymorphs recorded, the titan shaped tiamat and the titan shaped royal jelly.

19:35 < zackoid> i looked it up earlier

16:39 < zackoid> Hildebrand: is there more to that cloak?
16:50 < Hildebrand> oh, no, just typo of not closing loop
16:51 < zackoid> 8 strength is pretty good.  rpois is also pretty good.  i would probably use the strength one, then maybe reassess in lair
16:53 < Hildebrand> thats what i was thinking, just, yeah

17:03 < zackoid> wow that was really bad duration
17:04 < apoch> might be a very slight exageration but he wasn't dead when it wore off
17:09 < zackoid> well the important thing is that he died.
17:09 < zackoid> hopefully painfully.

17:42 < zackoid> it should chop heads
17:42 < apoch> it did not
17:43 < zackoid> that is weird.
17:43 < apoch> lair seems tougher
17:43 < zackoid>  16454 | Lair:4   | Noticed an eight-headed hydra
17:43 < zackoid>  16461 | Lair:4   | Killed an 11-headed hydra
17:43 < zackoid> seems like it did?
17:43 < apoch> it had 3 more heads than it started with
17:43 < zackoid> that's what i meant by chopping.
17:43 < apoch> ah
17:44 < apoch> For some reason I thought chop worked like fire
17:44 < apoch> Guess I was wrong
17:44 < zackoid> ah, nope.
21:34 < Hildebrand> nope, chop makes more heads appear
21:34 < Hildebrand> ice sometimes works though
21:34 < apoch> the only true answer is fire
21:37 < Hildebrand> pmuch
21:48 < zackoid> nuh uh, it's LARGE ROCKS
21:50 < OCTOTROG> porpoise (L1 GrEE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
21:50 < apoch> not everyone can throw large rocks
22:32 < zackoid> the actual answer is probably a rod of inaccuracy
22:33 < zackoid> since i think hydrae have 0 evasion.

17:08 <@slitherrr> no, chop makes it even more likely to make heads than usual
17:08 <@slitherrr> i say to the thing from like a day ago
17:11 < apoch> I thought new head chance was basically 100% a hit anyway
17:11 < zackoid> so did i.
17:41 < zackoid> looks like there's a reduced chance if you do very little damage, so by making you do more damage it makes it more likely?  is that what you meant slitherrr?
17:41 <@slitherrr> something like that
17:42 <@slitherrr> i thought it was handled specially but i haven't looked at the code
17:42 < zackoid> if you do 4 or less damage it's only 50% chance of adding heads it looks like

19:59 < zackoid> that's not an actual commit to the main branch, is it?
19:59 < zackoid> i thought that branch was considered a failure
20:25 < advil> I'm pretty sure that's been merged into master
20:25 < advil> it was cherrypicked from that branch
20:26 < advil> the wand still seems to be there
20:26 < advil> as is the potion
20:27 < advil> it was just merged into master a few hours ago (the 2 weeks is the time it was committed to that branch)
20:53 < zackoid> DCSS: all heavy armour all the time
21:05 < advil> I just checked and I've had spell haste on more than half of my wins
21:09 < advil> wand of hasting on 35/46 though
21:13 < advil> heh also it was memorized but not castable on 6 games
21:14 < advil> so spell haste on 20/46
22:29 < zackoid> advil: how many of those was it important for, though?
22:29 < zackoid> i actually think haste is overrated for <6 runes.  i just hate how there's almost no reasons left to ever cast spells unless you're blasting, and even that is not a good idea
22:32 < zackoid> the only times i recall haste being essential was for some spen type games, though it was really important for them
22:36 < odiv> it's fun on summoners!
22:36 < odiv> and makhleb followers
22:36 < odiv> here's a demon!
22:36 < odiv> Now it's hasted!

23:03 < OCTOTROG> boots of running[1/1]: -1 to movement delay (default is 10 for most races). Stacks with Swiftness. In 0.12 and older gave -2 delay.

23:11 < advil> I guess the muts got out of hand
23:12 < advil> they end up not so bad, just frail 1 is the only bad thing
23:12 < zackoid> but he had 2 cure mutes, and doing all that to end up with frail makes no sense
23:13 < advil> I was assuming that after all the shining eyes they were so bad that rolling the dice a few times seemed like a good idea?  didn't read the actual sequence of muts carefully
23:15 < zackoid> i wonder if some of those shines were intentional?  you can have bad luck with them but that seems like a lot
23:15 < zackoid> no ranged attack to speak of probably hurt
23:16 < advil> yeah that's what I was thinking

23:24 < odiv> advil: Yeah, I told him to maybe train and use a war axe for now and keep the exec axe in mind if he needs an xp dump later.
23:24 < odiv> also I don't know if I've ever read the tavern.
23:24 < odiv> I've rpobably been directed to a thread or two ages ago.

19:16 < advil> feature freeze yesterday, so I guess the tournament is coming up too
19:48 < zackoid> i ain't feelin' it.
20:56 < johnstein> zackoid: why is that trj change significantly more dangerous?
20:57 < johnstein> just that after killing trj you have to deal with getting surrounded?
21:06 < advil> I guess there's also now incentive to fight trj in the open, so that all the remaining jellies after he does don't immediately eat everything
21:06 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L1 HEWr) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]

21:20 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L7 HEWr) killed Duvessa. (D:4) [cbro+]
21:52 < zackoid> yeah, because you can't rely on the walls to limit number of adjacents after TRJ dies
21:52 < zackoid> if it'll make advil happy pretend i said "for formicids"
21:56 < zackoid> but the most dangerous things are usually acid blobs anyway
21:58 < OCTOTROG> TheNoid (L9 HEWr) killed Crazy Yiuf. (D:7) [cbro+]

02:54 < johnstein> it's full and apparently no one else has access to the server to rsync ttyrecs

11:20 <@shmup> surprised it's that poorly managed
11:21 <@shmup> they are v organized from a software standpoint
11:23 < zackoid> isn't it pretty common for devs to be really bad at IT?

12:03 <@shmup> yeah sure zackoid, like anything, there are going to be more people bad at a thing than good at a thing
12:04 <@shmup> but most people i'm friends with care about devops at least a little bit 
12:04 <@shmup> if youre gonna run a crawl server it'd be nice to know how to scale it up during tourneys. i understand that is $$ though and why they probably dont 
12:06 <@shmup> on my list of things id like to do and make as painless is possible might be running a crawl server that scales during moments needed and also is as cheap as possible w/ todays options
12:06 <@shmup> you know, instead of actually playing :)

19:10 < lukano> fyi I will be taking part in the nov 4th tourney, so please to be throwing me in a team somewhere :)
19:11 < lukano> and letting me know which one
--- Day changed Sat Oct 29 2016
11:30 < advil> hmm I guess someone should start a tournament thread
11:30 < advil> I'm going to be so absent for this tournament I'm not the right person :-/
13:36 < lukano> anyone kno what' sneeded to get HilariousDeathArtist's rc working in .19?  the include += HilariousDeathArtist.rc
13:36 < lukano> was working when .19 was in trunk, but since moving to tourney prep its not
13:59 < advil> not sure, what happens when you try to include it?
14:16 < advil> actually I wonder if it could be as simple as, the account just hasn't been updated to have the file for 0.19
14:16 < advil> assuming .rc files aren't automatically updated, which they usually aren't
14:20 < advil> yeah, if you're playing on cbro at least, that file doesn't exist yet
14:59 < sgun_> craaaawl
16:30 < lukano> advil: ah ok.  hope it gets populated out to other servers soon then :)
16:53 < lukano> oh I guess CAO hasn't pushed .19 off of trunk yet, so until that happens the rc won't have anywhere to sync up to
16:55 < lukano> oh and the guy actually plays on cszo, which I assume is having issues?
16:55 < lukano> er, or isnt hosting games at all anymore.  didnt know that :P
16:58 < zackoid> you should be able to copy everything off the github version
17:02 < lukano> yeah, I just did that
17:02 < lukano> had to copy and include all the nested rc's as well
17:02 < lukano> but dumping them all in the .rc, above the actual HDA.rc worked just fine as far as I can tell
17:02 < lukano> messy, but works :P
17:08 < lukano> bot not announcing?
17:30 < advil> CSZO has been dead for a little bit
17:30 < advil> I did read that CAO was having some disk problems lately, so that might be part of it
17:31 < advil> the bot announcements may have changed depending on the server?  not sure
17:31 < advil> CBRO should announce though
17:31 < advil> !lm .
17:31 < advil> or maybe OCTOTROG is taking a nap
17:31 < OCTOTROG> 6594. [2016-07-26 20:12:27] advil the Martial Artist (L14 TrHu of Jiyva) left the Swamp on turn 28363. (Swamp:1)

13:23 < advil> hmm, so, anyone interested in running the organizing thread?
13:23 < advil> I'm willing to start the MFC thread if no one else does it, with the caveat that I'll be kind of out of the loop for the first week and a half of the tournament
13:24 < advil> I should be paying enough attention to be able to sort out team assignments I guess, though maybe a 2nd would be helpful

13:11 < kimtrucks> hello
13:27 < lukano> hey kim
13:30 < kimtrucks> so is there a guide I can read?
13:32 < roj> The getting started on the wiki was pretty good for me but I have an extensive-ass nethack background.
13:32 < roj> Let me dig out a link.
13:33 < roj> Are you playing for the first time thie tourney?
13:33 < roj> If so, woo.
13:33 < roj> (if not, woo too)
13:35 < kimtrucks> first time this tourney, yup
13:35 < roj> Neat!
13:35 < roj> Uhm.
13:37 < roj> Thhere it is!
13:37 < roj> http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Beef_Jerky%27s_Simple_3_Rune_Minotaur_Berserker_Guide_for_Beginners
13:37 < roj> This character guide goes over actual commands and things.
13:37 < kimtrucks> thanks, emailing to myself for later reading
13:37 < roj> Go ahead and let regerences to gods flow right out your ears.
13:37 < zackoid> lemme check that guide to see if it's nonsense
13:38 < zackoid> much of the wiki is, unfortunately, because the devs and good players mostly shun it
13:38 < roj> They're like a second layer of class abilities, the god you pick, and they don't REALLLLY come up until a little later.
13:38 < roj> Ha, true. I welcome your second opinion.
13:38 < zackoid> there are some good guides in the DCSS threats on MFC, but there are like 30 DCSS threads so i might have to dig for awhile
13:38 < roj> This was bookmarked in my deepet folder.
13:38 < roj> Right next to alt.binaries.other.minotaur.sources
13:38 < zackoid> also DCSS changes so much with every version it's really hard to keep long-form guides up to date
13:39 < zackoid> "q: I don't know what quaff means but it makes you drink potions "
13:39 < zackoid> hopes are soaring!
13:39 < roj> Heh.
13:40 < roj> They told be to brandish then quaff a tincture so I quit and joined the volleyball team.
13:41 < roj> Yeah, on restrospect, this is till doing a forkload of assuming.
13:41 < kimtrucks> I've played GUI roguelikes a bunch
13:41 < kimtrucks> so I'm familiar with quaffing
13:41 < kimtrucks> sorry
13:42 < kimtrucks> I guess I should phrase it as "roguelikes with actual graphics" lest someone argue that hack has a GUI because it does show you things in a 2D plane
13:42 < zackoid> i haven't read 90% of it but it mostly looks ok.  there is some stuff that is out of date and some stuff that is misguded but if you've literally never played before it at least has some reasoning about things.  
13:42 < lukano> I dont think this # subscribes to that level of neckbeardery
13:43 < zackoid> i like that it includes the tiles for some dangerous enemies, but i didn't read any of that part because it's super long
13:43 < lukano> to nitpick the gui definition, that is :P
13:43 < zackoid> kimtrucks: for the record crawls has tiles and you should use them, specifically webtiles for the tournament.  
13:44 < lukano> agreed.  crawl tiles is the best way to play
13:44 < lukano> *web-tiles
13:45 < roj> Heck yeah.
13:45 < kimtrucks> so the most rogue-like roguelike I've played is probably Dredmor
13:45 < roj> I think you'll be fine with a few roguelikes under your belt, then.
13:45 < kimtrucks> or one of the other related ones
13:46 < roj> Yeah, a lot maps. The controls might be confusing, but the in-game help is pretty straightforward.
13:46 < lukano> here's my advice to new players ; use webtiles, try a melee class (minotaur berserker for exaple) to start, be sure to check your skill pane (a) and effects (shift-a) lists at times, and always kite enemies back to the up stairs as only the closest tiles can follow you back up
13:46 < zackoid> here's slitherrr's guide, also pretty old already: http://pastebin.com/c3fR1EzR
13:46 < lukano> or as with all roguelikes, if you can't go back up, find a hallway to minimize angles of attack
13:46 < kimtrucks> thanks guys!
13:47 < zackoid> people usually are happy to watch and give pointers because it's impossible to learn via infodump.  but the dump will help you get the first 20 deaths out of the way.
13:48 < lukano> the crawl wiki si a handy reference but as mentioned not always up to date
13:50 < zackoid> kimtrucks: there's also an in-game tutorial that you might want to run through even before reading just to get a frame of reference for the map
13:54 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L18 MiBe) found a barnacled rune of Zot. (Shoals:4) [cbro]

15:13 < odiv> and off painkillers already.
15:39 <@slitherrr> huh, no more salamander stormcallers, i wonder why
15:39 <@slitherrr> i wonder how long until we completely forget about maud
15:41 < odiv> Maybe fire storm is going?
15:42 < odiv> I hope not
15:42 <@slitherrr> haste is gone!!
15:44 <@slitherrr> i'm so sad, that's the centerpiece of the ogam death build
15:44 <@slitherrr> well that and the enormous club
15:49 < odiv> I know.
15:49 < odiv> I told johnstein he should threaten to shut down cbro until they put it back in.
16:04 < kimtrucks> odiv I'm glad it went well!
16:22 < kimtrucks> how's she feeling?
17:25 < odiv> She's feeling well.
17:38 < zackoid> i feel like there's less and less reason to ever not wear plate the entire game now

18:35 < Kimtruck> for some reason the ? menu wasn't letting me page down/up
18:35 < advil> that sounds annoying
18:35 < advil> are you playing tiles?
18:35 < Kimtruck> yup, on johnstein's server
18:36 < Kimtruck> I blame the tutorial somehow
18:37 < advil> + and - should work for scrolling up and down on the key reference screen even if page up/down aren't for some reason

20:23 < OCTOTROG> chain mail[1/2]: 8AC, 15ER.
20:23 < Hildebrand> ??scale mail
20:23 < OCTOTROG> scale mail[1/1]: 6AC, 10 ER.
20:28 < Hildebrand> ??axes
20:28 < OCTOTROG> axes[1/1]: (acc,dam,delay,mindelay) [hands]: hand axe (+3/7/1.3/0.6), war axe (+0/11/1.5/0.7), broad axe (-2/13/1.6/0.7), battleaxe (-4/15/1.7/0.7) [2], executioner's axe (-6/18/2.0/0.7) [2]. All axes {cleave} and chop hydra heads.
20:31 < Kimtruck> is a battleaxe better than a +2 venomous hand axe? I assume so, but
20:31 <@ZureaL> Kimtruck, it depends on what your training level in axes is
20:31 < advil> it probably is, but the tradeoff is weapon speed
20:31 < Kimtruck> 10.8
20:32 <@ZureaL> if you hit '@', it'll show you what your attack speed is when wielding
20:32 < Kimtruck> of course attack speed is a thing
20:32 < advil> I'd use a battleaxe over a hand axe at that skill level
20:32 < advil> unless it was an electric hand axe or something
20:32 <@ZureaL> yea, I'd probably focus trainning on nothing but axes too
20:33 < advil> crawl has so many misc details...it's a bit absurd really
20:33 < advil> why did I fill my brain up with this stuff
20:33 <@ZureaL> hahah...amen advil 
20:35 < advil> I wonder if this is one of those rounds where putting thenoid on the cbros team would be a better bet for competitive
20:35 <@ZureaL> well if none of the other cbro's are going to play, just put johnstein and greynaab on the compet team
20:35 < advil> although the bros seem to not be so into this tournament either
20:35 < advil> ah right
20:36 < advil> shouldn't zackoid be on competitive?
20:36 < advil> !lg t0.18 won s=name
20:36 < OCTOTROG> One game for advil (t0.18 won): advil
20:36 < advil> !lg@mfc  t0.18 won s=name
20:36 < advil> ugh
20:36 < advil> !lg @mfc  t0.18 won s=name
20:36 < OCTOTROG> 25 games for @mfc (t0.18 won): 5x zackoid, 5x TheNoid, 3x odiv, 3x Almightybob, 2x sleevener, 2x staplegun, JerBear56, greynaab, porpoise, advil, isthmus
20:36 < Kimtruck> well it's now a +1 battleaxe to boot
20:36 < advil> he's definitely competitive by that metric
20:37 <@ZureaL> advil, he wasn't sure if he was going to actually feel like playing
20:37 < advil> ah
20:37 < advil> well I'm not sure if I actually can play :)
20:38 < advil> I bet once he starts playing he will keep going
20:39 < advil> I'm traveling to europe sunday and then back the sunday after, plus this first weekend is shot :-/
20:40 < zackoid> but there are witchers to witch
20:40 < johnstein> I think jer and Jacob might play
20:40 < johnstein> and maybe zombie
20:40 < johnstein> so we could have 5
20:40 < johnstein> I just haven't had any time to do any coordination
20:41 < johnstein> people keep trying to say we are the competitive team. we really aren't
20:41 < johnstein> we just got stuck with being the de facto competitive team since everyone else insisted on being casual or semi-casual
20:42 < johnstein> personally I think most of us are about semi-competitive/casual. cept for a few obvious aces. heh
20:42 < advil> well you guys always have like 4-6 wins as a baseline, and if you add thenoid to that it could be a lot
20:42 < zackoid> i would be more interested in playing if runes 6-15 didn't exist.
20:43 <@ZureaL> I've never had a win of more than 5 runes
20:43 < Kimtruck> hungry ghosts can go straight to hell. not dead.
20:44 < advil> they're a bit annoying
20:44 < advil> they're sort of a lesson in: try walking away from things that aren't yet next to you
20:45 < johnstein> advil: zombie and Jacob (bob) always do really well.  I usually don't have time to play
20:46 < johnstein> but really my point was, I don't think we need to necessarily consider cbros competitive, but we can certainly fill the niche if needed. I will have more info tomorrow after I harass the bros
20:48 < zackoid> it's this week already, right?
20:48 < zackoid> jeez
20:51 < Kimtruck> survived my first catoblepas
20:57 < Kimtruck> Killed Erica
20:59 < Kimtruck> .goog orcish mines
20:59 < Kimtruck> ah wrong channel
21:00 < Kimtruck> ??orcish mines
21:00 < OCTOTROG> orcish mines[1/6]: Found in the main dungeon, between D:9 and D:12. Two levels deep.
21:00 < Hildebrand> usually you wait on mines
21:00 < Hildebrand> think its like you go to d10, lair, mines
21:01 < Hildebrand> TheNoid, here to school us all
21:02 < Kimtruck> believe I am about to be killed by a bee bodybuard
21:02 < TheNoid> I'm mostly just here to sit around and do nothing.
21:03 < TheNoid> Bees are pretty much the worst.
21:03 < advil> bees suck
21:03 < advil> only shrikes are worse, and they are really just bees
21:03 < Kimtruck> nope from 3hp to 25 again
21:04 < Kimtruck> goddamn it teleported out of royal jelly chamber during a rest
21:05 < Kimtruck> well that wasn't that bad
21:05 < Kimtruck> no idea what pulled me out but neither of the baddies looked like spellcasters
21:06 < Kimtruck> ok am I wearing some sort of joke teleportation gear? 
21:07 < johnstein> ring of tele?
21:07 < johnstein> % I think
21:07 < johnstein> look for *tele
21:08 < johnstein> * means random.

21:17 < zackoid> !!lg Kimtruck s=xl
21:18 < OCTOTROG> One game for Kimtruck: 12
21:18 < zackoid> d:12 on your first ever game is pretty far.
21:20 < Kimtruck> my two luckiest breaks: a +2 handaxe of venom before I even got into dungeon
21:20 < Kimtruck> and randomly reading a fear scroll when I was surrounded by Prince Ribbit and, err, Other Named Dude that somehow led to them both dying
21:24 < Kimtruck> thanks to Hildebrand for lots of help!
21:35 < lukano> d12 on first game is probably 3x as deep as I did on my first game
21:40 < Hildebrand> shmup, want someone to post that on the forums for you too?
21:40 < Hildebrand> also, how cometative/casual?
21:41 < Kimtruck> lukano well I had Hildebrand teaching me how to train skills and such
21:49 < Kimtruck> oh god Natasha's a 9 lives pun, isn't she
21:50 < Kimtruck> ??natasha
21:50 < OCTOTROG> natasha[1/4]: A felid unique. Comes back to life after she dies, losing 1 HD and 5 max hp each time.
21:50 < Kimtruck> _Mordus's ghost (amateur Tengu Fire Elementalist) comes into view. It is wielding a weapon of electrocution.
21:51 < Kimtruck> uhhh that sounds deeply bad
21:51 < Kimtruck> I've turned myself into a tree

21:53 < Hildebrand> Kimtruck, 
21:53 < Kimtruck> yeah I was depseration-quaffing under the idea that cure potions are likely to be found in higher quantities
21:54 < Kimtruck> it actually saved me since I had just put on Trog's Hand and the adders couldn't damage me as a tree
21:56 < Kimtruck> ok off to bed after dying to a named baddie
21:56 < Kimtruck> thanks again for the help
22:47 < odiv> you also get rpois in tree form

07:53 < OCTOTROG> mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 8 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A short club with a metal head.
07:55 < Kimtruck> ??armour
07:55 < OCTOTROG> armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.
07:56 < Kimtruck> just found a vampiric whip for my maces character
07:58 < Kimtruck> the cursed +0 whip of a volcano (weapon) {vamp, Fragile rC- rN++ Int+10}
08:03 < Kimtruck> and dead on d:5 to some Beogh-worshipping mage
08:07 < Kimtruck> amulet of guardian spirit on my beserker, yeah
08:40 <@laceratedsky> ??steam dragon scales
08:40 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled steam_dragon_scales in my learndb.
08:44 < zackoid> that's odd.
08:44 < zackoid> laceratedsky: scales are the same as dragon armour used to be
08:44 < zackoid> they just renamed it, and you no longer need that first enchant scrolls
08:44 < zackoid> ??sda
08:44 < OCTOTROG> sda[1/1]: see {steam dragon armour}, {swamp dragon armour}, {storm dragon armour} or {shadow dragon armour}
08:45 < zackoid> ??steam dragon armour
08:45 < OCTOTROG> steam dragon armour[1/1]: 5AC, 0ER, rSteam. Can be created by enchanting a steam dragon hide.
08:45 < zackoid> that's just out of date.
08:47 <@laceratedsky> cool, thank you
08:47 <@laceratedsky> and also, when the fuck did hydras start showing up on D9?
08:48 < zackoid> they always have, just rarely
08:49 < OCTOTROG> laceratedsky the Cleaver (L10 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, mangled by a white ugly thing on D:8, with 6289 points after 7972 turns and 0:34:42. [cbro]
08:49 <@laceratedsky> damnit!
08:52 < zackoid> RIP ('d to shreds)
09:29 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) entered the Vestibule of Hell. (Depths:1) [cbro]
09:31 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) killed Geryon. (Hell) [cbro]
09:31 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Basher (L10 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, blasted by an electric eel (bolt of electricity) on D:8, with 5439 points after 7014 turns and 0:31:50. [cbro]

09:33 < zackoid> oh wait nevermind.  i was thinking of shock serpents
09:35 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) entered the Realm of Zot. (Depths:5) [cbro]
09:53 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) reached level 5 of the Realm of Zot. (Zot:5) [cbro]
10:02 < Kimtruck> ??amulet of faith
10:02 < OCTOTROG> amulet of faith[1/2]: Piety increases one quarter faster. Yes, this means you get more gifts. Ru offers sacrifices more quickly; Xom has more dynamic piety and acts more often; no effect with Gozag. Removing the amulet reduces your piety by 1/3.
10:04 < zackoid> it is very good.  especially if you already put it on.
10:06 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L27 MiBe) found the Orb of Zot! (Zot:5) [cbro]
10:06 < OCTOTROG> Watch lukano at: http://crawl.berotato.org:8080/#watch-lukano [cbro]
10:13 < lukano> ding ding
10:13 < OCTOTROG> lukano the Conqueror (L27 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, escaped with the Orb and 4 runes, with 2067146 points after 98089 turns and 5:34:33. [cbro]
10:15 < lukano> probably could have grabbed at least the abyssal rune and the icy rune, ontop of what I had... but figured I'd cash in the win rather than get greedy
10:15 < lukano> the last 4 or 5 end game runs have died due to greed :)
10:19 < zackoid> why icy?
10:20 < lukano> i had rc+++, reflect, flying, and demon whip of fire -- so I figured I'd stand a reasonable chance
10:20 < lukano> plus the high ac and str 
10:21 < lukano> that said I've never done that branch before so I may be wrong :)
10:21 < Kimtruck> so was the refc to turn off or reprioritize main weapon training at level 16?
10:22 < zackoid> it depends on the weapon.
10:22 < zackoid> ^dump Kimtruck

10:24 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
10:24 < zackoid> that's what it shows for me, must be cached
10:24 < roj> feature request: 'itsnotyouitsme' alias for dump
10:25 < zackoid> so for a flail you don't want to train much past 14
10:25 < zackoid> but soon you'll find a bigger mace
10:25 < roj> ...
10:25 < roj> Why/
10:25 < roj> For cross skill bonues for superior weapon classes?
10:25 < zackoid> i would stop focusing maces but keep training them to 20.  you want a great mace eventually.
10:25 < zackoid> roj: why stop training at 14?
10:26 < roj> Yes, that is the question, zackatio.
10:26 < zackoid> because at that skill you are swining it as fast as is possible, and further investments have very small returns on your damage output.
10:27 < zackoid> swinging.
10:27 < roj> Ah, okay.
10:28 < zackoid> i comissioned this from shmup:
10:28 < zackoid> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/dcss-weapons.txt
10:28 < zackoid> though it is wrong in a few places, it is less wrong than the version on the wiki 
10:30 < Kimtruck> thanks guys!
10:30 < roj> MefightClub: Less wrong than the wiki.
10:31 < Kimtruck> at what point does enchanted armor of one type become less useful than unenchanted armor of next level up?
10:31 < Kimtruck> specficially +2 fire resistant chain vs normal plate
10:31 < Kimtruck> ??lair
10:31 < OCTOTROG> lair[1/2]: Accessed from the main dungeon somewhere between levels 8 and 11. Six levels deep (eight in 0.18-). The lair is full of "natural" critters such as rats, snakes, and yaks. One of Swamp/Shoals and one of Snake/Spider appears there, as well as Slime, and there is a relatively hard vault on Lair:8. The petting zoo of Crawl, if petting zoos had hydras.
10:31 < zackoid> Kimtruck: for armour i usually just put it on and compare AC+EV, taking the higher.
10:32 < zackoid> the resists have value, of course, if it's close
10:32 < Kimtruck> ??AC
10:32 < OCTOTROG> armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.
10:32 < Kimtruck> ??EV
10:33 < OCTOTROG> ev[1/5]: Shorthand for evasion (the stat). It is improved by Dodging skill, equipment with evasion bonuses, and the repulsion field mutation; it is worsened by equipment with evasion penalties.
10:33 < zackoid> they should be shown in the top right
10:34 < Kimtruck> oh I just wanted to know what exactly they did
10:34 < Kimtruck> since it was +1 to AC, -1 to EV
10:34 < Kimtruck> to switch to plate
10:35 < zackoid> in that case i would wear the chain
10:35 < zackoid> as i'm sure you figured out
10:36 < Kimtruck> ??slay
10:36 < OCTOTROG> slay ~ slaying[1/3]: Works like weapon {enchantment}. Magic is unaffected.
10:37 < Kimtruck> ok this drops my AC by 1 compared to fire resistance, but it's a named +3 Slay chainmail
10:38 < Kimtruck> so... I'll do that
10:39 < zackoid> slay is very good, so probably the right choice.  having said that you'll now run into a nasty fire-branded enemy
10:42 < Kimtruck> I'm a tree again as I try to aovid dying. sigh. 
10:43 < roj> Which will also not work against fire.
10:43 < roj> IIRC 'i'm a tree' is pretty powerful.
10:43 < roj> So really, you're winning!
10:44 < Kimtruck> ??snake pit
10:44 < OCTOTROG> snake pit[1/3]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere between levels 3 and 6. Four levels deep. The serpentine rune lies at the bottom, and the greater nagas are renowned for their charm and hospitality. Half of all games contain this branch; the others contain {Spider Nest}.
10:48 < Kimtruck> ??shoals
10:48 < OCTOTROG> shoals[1/4]: Lair branch that can replace Swamp. It has tides, merfolk (including javelineers and aquamancers), {kraken}, snapping turtles, sea snakes, cyclopes, and harpies. It is 4 levels deep and has the barnacled rune at the end.
10:53 < Kimtruck> ??fan of gales
10:53 < OCTOTROG> fan of gales[1/1]: The air {elemental evoker}: causes a burst of wind which throws back nearby monsters and clouds. Does not affect clouds on your own square.
10:55 < Kimtruck> a lovely god gift in a weapon type I don't use
10:55 < Kimtruck> ??executioner
10:55 < OCTOTROG> executioner[1/2]: Completely unlike ogres for the end game - cannot be outrun without controlled magical translocations, hits for up to 150 damage per turn of yours, sees invisible, and resists elemental magic. Fortunately it's not too hard to kill and can't fly. And with 9 hits to spread damage over, high-AC chars are in little danger.
10:56 < Kimtruck> ??executioner's axe
10:56 < OCTOTROG> executioner's axe[1/2]: (axes; -6 acc / 18 dam / 2.0 base delay / 0.7 min delay at 26 skill; two handed). You want axes? You want them big? You want to swing your axe into the guts of demons? Do the demons have HUGE GUTS you want to RIP AND TEAR? Then this axe is for you.
10:57 < roj> I'm not, generally speaking, a fan of gales.
10:58 < roj> Uncle Henry ALONE. Man up and parent, man. You have 3 farm hands freeing up your time.
11:07 < Kimtruck> ??slime pits
11:07 < OCTOTROG> slime pits[1/2]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere on levels 5 or 6 (on Lair:6-8 in 0.18-). Five levels deep (six in 0.18-), with a rune in the loot vault at the bottom, surrounded by stone (vulnerable to LRD/shatter but not passwall/digging) walls. Killing the royal jelly turns the walls into diggable glass. The {slime wall}s hurt to touch!
11:08 < Kimtruck> ??antimagic
11:08 < OCTOTROG> antimagic[1/2]: A weapon brand which makes monsters sometimes lose a turn when they try to cast spells. Wielding it reduces max mp by 2/3, getting hit by it depletes mp. Works on everything that has non-divine spells, including demons, orbs of fire, electric golems, etc.
11:10 < Kimtruck> ??ice
11:10 < OCTOTROG> book of ice[1/1]: Ice Form (in 0.16+), Metabolic Englaciation, Ozocubu's Refrigeration, Bolt of Cold, Freezing Cloud, Simulacrum
11:13 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Bludgeoner (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by a six-headed hydra on Lair:6, with 37202 points after 15266 turns and 1:16:24. [cbro]
11:14 < roj> hydras, man.
11:15 < Kimtruck> the hydras haven't been giving me problems

11:37 < zackoid> ??tree form
11:37 < OCTOTROG> tree form[1/3]: Immobile form with -Tele, +50% HP, 20 + XL/2 AC, minimal EV, rN+++, rPois, torment immunity, and gives +12 base UC damage. Unlike statue form, tree form does NOT give rot or poison immunity.
11:37 < zackoid> i almost never use that, though it is good in the very early game.  your defenses were probably better without it, plus you could move and teleport away.
11:38 < Kimtruck> but hey
11:38 < Kimtruck> I got to lair on my whateverth game
11:39 < Kimtruck> I'm happy about that
11:39 < zackoid> the bottom of lair, even
11:39 < Kimtruck> basically I was hoping tree form would kill the poison
11:39 < Kimtruck> as I can see now... it doesn't
11:41 < zackoid> 0 potions of curing is odd, did you already use a bunch?
11:42 < zackoid> ^help
11:43 < Kimtruck> I picked up 1 potion of curing all game
11:44 < Kimtruck> and 1 or 2 of healing
11:46 < zackoid> that's rare, usually curing is by far the most common\
12:08 < Kimtruck> ??ring of fire
12:08 < OCTOTROG> ring of fire[1/1]: A ring of fire (jewellery) acts as a positive fire enhancer and gives rF+ rC-. Not to be confused with {ring of flames}, a spell. In 0.18- also give a negative ice enhancer.

12:12 < OCTOTROG> xl[1/1]: Affects hp, mp, mr, stats, spell levels, and the highest level of spells you can cast. And chance to resist various effects such as mephitic cloud confusion.
12:13 < Kimtruck> ??SH
12:13 < OCTOTROG> shield[1/5]: Wearing a shield gives you a chance to block all damage from some attacks, including arrows, melee, and some spells. Shields prevent off-hand attacks, and until you have enough skill they also slow your melee attacks and make it harder to cast spells.
12:14 < Kimtruck> ??dire flail
12:14 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.
12:14 < Kimtruck> is there any way to compare my damage output directly?
12:14 < Kimtruck> ??protection
12:14 < OCTOTROG> protection[1/1]: Bonus AC. On rings, anywhere from -6 to +6. On weapons, gives +7 AC for up to 5 turns when you successfully hit a monster that isn't {firewood}. In 0.18- gave +5 AC always when wielded. On shields, +3 AC. You could also have learned any of this by viewing the in-game item description.
12:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> ummm, i don't know of one
12:17 < zackoid> Kimtruck: not easily.
12:17 < Kimtruck> ??flail
12:17 < OCTOTROG> flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; +0 acc / 10 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A mace with a short chain connecting the head to the haft.
12:17 < zackoid> between two weapons, you mean?
12:17 < Kimtruck> yeah
12:18 < Kimtruck> I got a +2 flail of protection and an unenchanted dire flail. the 'of protection' makes me really inclined to keep the non-dire flail
12:18 < omnomnOMINOUS> seems reasonable for now
12:18 < Kimtruck> ??crude
12:18 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled crude in my learndb.
12:19 < omnomnOMINOUS> crude means it's an artifact
12:19 < zackoid> yeah i would, for now, but that flail is a pretty bad weapon in the long run.
12:20 < zackoid> the way combat works in DCSS is extremely complicated, and the only accurate way to compare weapons is using the simulator in wizard mode, but that is a huge pain, so 95% of the time you default to rules of thumb
12:26 < Kimtruck> ??phantom mirror
12:26 < OCTOTROG> phantom mirror[1/4]: An evocable - creates a friendly illusory duplicate of a target monster; consumed on use. Duration increases with Evocations and decreases with target's MR (minimum duration is 6). Stacks in your inventory! For the rakshasa ability, see {rakshasa[2]}.
12:31 < Kimtruck> ??minotaur's labyrinth
12:31 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled minotaur's_labyrinth in my learndb.
12:32 < Kimtruck> ??labyrinth
12:32 < OCTOTROG> labyrinth[1/7]: Look for a cyan \ (or ? depending on your character set) on a level where you hear an "ancient clock" or "distant snort". (1-in-15 chance per level, once per game). Hurry, it times out much more quickly than other portals (you get urgent-sounding messages). Note that magic mapping will show where the lab entrance is.
12:34 < omnomnOMINOUS> try to get in close vs the orb spiders; they're dangerous from range but not really up close
12:38 < odiv> ^whereis kimtruck
12:39 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Bludgeoner (L12 MiBe), a worshipper of Trog, is currently on Lair:3 after 10913 turns. [cbro]
12:39 < odiv> I'm getting crazy lag in this irc thing.
12:40 < odiv> I think it's from this PC to my home server.
12:40 < omnomnOMINOUS> hi odiv! _o/
12:42 < odiv> hey, what's up?
12:42 < odiv> oh wow, lag is gone, that's great
12:43 < odiv> So Kim, have you heard the good news about Vehumet yet?
12:43 < omnomnOMINOUS> wait i have not heard the good news about vehumet
12:44 < odiv> Vehumet is your God and will assist you in raining down unending fire upon your enemies.
12:44 < omnomnOMINOUS> oh that good news
12:44 < odiv> Only the most important news.
12:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> ok yes i have heard that =P
12:45 < odiv> Would you take a pamphlet?
12:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> haha sure, is it a manual of conjurations?
12:45 < odiv> It's actually just a piece of paper that's on fire.
12:45 < omnomnOMINOUS> i was thinking if anyone still needs a team name, "Mornings Are For Coffee And Conjurations" would be a good one
12:45 < odiv> I need to hand them out quickly, for obvious reasons.
12:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> lol
12:46 < Kimtruck> I'm fine being a MiBe for now
12:47 < Kimtruck> ??oklob
12:47 < OCTOTROG> oklob plant[1/7]: An immobile plant that spits acid. Can be affected by hexes.
12:47 < omnomnOMINOUS> it's like a turret basically; unless it's guarding something important it's easiest to just avoid the headache and go elsewhere
12:48 < odiv> if you need to get rid of it, then it can't see invis
12:48 < odiv> !polytheist
12:49 < odiv> !!polytheist

12:50 < OCTOTROG> Unwon species for odiv: Felid, Formicid, Mummy, Ogre, Spriggan, Tengu
12:52 < omnomnOMINOUS> ok off to the gym; bbl. good luck kim! a couple thoughts from spectating: (1) start thinking about running away sooner (at 1/2 health), (2) use consumables liberally, and (3) if something notices you, back up far away to an already-explored spot, and let it come to you; the sound it makes will attract more monsters
12:53 < Kimtruck> ??slime pits
12:53 < OCTOTROG> slime pits[1/2]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere on levels 5 or 6 (on Lair:6-8 in 0.18-). Five levels deep (six in 0.18-), with a rune in the loot vault at the bottom, surrounded by stone (vulnerable to LRD/shatter but not passwall/digging) walls. Killing the royal jelly turns the walls into diggable glass. The {slime wall}s hurt to touch!
12:53 < Kimtruck> thanks omnomnOMINOUS !
12:53 < omnomnOMINOUS> slime pits are super dangerous don't go in there
13:04 < odiv> pits are usually for the post endgame
13:04 < odiv> or extended or w/e
13:06 < Kimtruck> +8 antimagic great mace on a berserker
13:06 < Kimtruck> this should be good
13:07 < odiv> sweet
13:07 < odiv> I <3 Antimagic
13:08 < odiv> though usually on something fast
13:08 < Kimtruck> ??steam dragon armor
13:08 < OCTOTROG> steam dragon armor ~ steam dragon armour[1/1]: 5AC, 0ER, rSteam. Can be created by enchanting a steam dragon hide.
13:08 < odiv> 0ER is too light
13:09 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Warrior (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, blasted by a fire dragon (blast of flame) on Lair:6, with 41664 points after 16237 turns and 1:17:43. [cbro]
13:10 < odiv> oh no
13:13 < odiv> rip :(
13:16 < roj> It'd be neat to get an extended death available (in a quicker version than dump).
13:17 < roj> like Kimtruck was poisoned, turning to stone, and out of mp. there were 15 harpies nearby.
13:22 < greynaab> ^whereis
13:22 < OCTOTROG> greynaab the Spry (L25 SpHu), a worshipper of Jiyva, saved on Depths:2 on 2016-05-22 after 123802 turns. [cbro]

13:27 < zackoid> i onced finished a game 366 days after start.  
13:31 < zackoid> i wish i could remember where rc files are
13:31 < odiv> o
13:31 < odiv> I think, right?
13:31 < odiv> o for edit options
13:32 < zackoid> i mean from irc, i try not to hit the actual game pages from work
13:32 < odiv> you mean from ssh?
13:32 < odiv> or can you somehow edit them via irc?
13:33 < zackoid> i don't even want to edit it, just read it
13:35 < odiv> !!rc odiv
13:35 < odiv> does that work?
13:35 < odiv> hm
13:35 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.akrasiac.org/rcfiles/crawl-git/odiv.rc
13:35 < odiv> change url to cbro and you?

13:36 < odiv> !^rc zackoid
13:36 < odiv> I don't think ^^ is a thing.
13:36 < zackoid> i think i tried that and they were in another directory on cbro
13:36 < zackoid> yeah.
13:36 < odiv> We use !! to pass unknown commands straight through.
13:36 < odiv> afaik
13:37 < zackoid> i thought that was just sequel
13:37 < zackoid> i can never remember the bot operators.  i even made a db entry about the bot operators but i can't remember the bot operator for the db
14:03 < Kimtruck> 1st level of dungeon, +5 int ring for a beserker. yup. this'll be useful.
14:10 < Kimtruck> ??potion of mutation
14:10 < OCTOTROG> potion of mutation[1/1]: Attempts to give you three random mutations. Also, outputs the message "you feel extremely strange" whether it succeeds or not -- if you're looking here to see what that message means, you probably quaffed this while resistant to mutations.
14:20 < Kimtruck> ??inference
14:20 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled inference in my learndb.

14:20 < Kimtruck> hmmm
14:20 < Kimtruck> new brand?
14:21 < Kimtruck> rF+, Str+4
14:22 < zackoid> ??randart
14:22 < OCTOTROG> randart[1/5]: A randomly generated artefact; its appearance and name have no special significance. Keep in mind that artefact status by itself does not dictate worthiness. A +8 randart hand axe (with +3 str) is still not a battleaxe, and a +5 ring mail (with +rage) is still not a plate mail.
14:23 < zackoid> randarts can have properties that don't normally generate on items of that type
14:23 < zackoid> and also multiple properties
14:39 <@slitherrrr> and some fixedart stuff has stuff that doesn't even generate on randarts
14:39 <@slitherrrr> ??crusher
14:39 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled crusher in my learndb.
14:39 <@slitherrrr> ??punk
14:39 < OCTOTROG> punk[1/1]: An {unrand} +3 {fustibalus} with an acid ego (same as {acidic bite}) that grants rCorr. In 0.18-, a +7 greatsling with freeze ego and rC+.

14:40 < OCTOTROG> unrandart[1/2]: An artefact of fixed appearance and properties - sometimes unique ones that are unavailable anywhere else. Info at: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/art-data.txt
14:41 <@slitherrrr> ??skullcrusher
14:41 <@slitherrrr> there
14:41 < OCTOTROG> skullcrusher[1/1]: The +3 giant club "Skullcrusher" {speed, Str+7}.
14:42 <@slitherrrr> or sometimes fixedarts are things that no longer exist but were just too awesome to die
14:42 <@slitherrrr> like
14:42 <@slitherrrr> ??autumn
14:42 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled autumn in my learndb.
14:43 <@slitherrrr> ??autumn katana
14:43 < OCTOTROG> autumn katana[1/1]: (long blades; +3 acc / 14 dam / 1.2 base delay / 0.6 min delay). A +8 vorpal katana {clarity} that didn't get the news about katana removal.
14:43 <@slitherrrr> (that weapon is amazing by the way)
14:43 <@slitherrrr> ??eudemon blade
14:43 < OCTOTROG> eudemon blade[1/3]: (long blades; -2 acc / 14 dam / 1.2 base delay / 0.6 min delay). Created by having The Shining One {bless} a demon blade.
14:44 < Kimtruck> ??scroll of brand weapon
14:44 < OCTOTROG> scroll of brand weapon[1/2]: Adds a random brand to a non-artefact, non-blowgun weapon (see[2]). Rebranding away from wielded distortion does not cause a distortion unwield effect.
14:44 <@slitherrrr> ??scroll of brand weapon[2
14:44 < OCTOTROG> scroll of brand weapon[2/2]: Brands melee weapons to: 19.0% flaming, 19.0% freezing, 15.8% vorpal, 12.7% venom, 9.49% drain, 9.49% electrocution, 7.59% protection, 5.06% vampiricism, 1.90% chaos. Ranged weapons: 25% flame, 25% frost, 16.6% venom, 16.6% vorpal, 10% evasion, 4.2% electrocution, 2.5% chaos. Reroll if same as current brand or disliked by your god.
14:44 < Kimtruck> ??crushing
14:44 < OCTOTROG> vorpal[1/3]: A weapon brand which increases weapon damage by 16.7% on average.
14:45 <@slitherrrr> vorpal is better than it sounds
14:45 <@slitherrrr> less damage+ than flaming or freezing, but it works on everything
15:02 < Kimtruck> ??lair
15:02 < OCTOTROG> lair[1/2]: Accessed from the main dungeon somewhere between levels 8 and 11. Six levels deep (eight in 0.18-). The lair is full of "natural" critters such as rats, snakes, and yaks. One of Swamp/Shoals and one of Snake/Spider appears there, as well as Slime, and there is a relatively hard vault on Lair:8. The petting zoo of Crawl, if petting zoos had hydras.
15:09 < Kimtruck> ??haste
15:09 < OCTOTROG> haste[1/1]: Reduces action delay by 33%. Most commonly found as a potion of haste (formerly known as speed), wand of hasting, and a level 6 Charms spell.
15:15 < Kimtruck> ??amulet of piety
15:15 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled amulet_of_piety in my learndb.
15:15 < Kimtruck> ????amulet of faith
15:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> amulet of faith is good
15:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> much better than gourmand
15:15 < Kimtruck> yeah I'm just trying to figure out which amulet to wear
15:15 < Kimtruck> well that answers one of my two maulet questions
15:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> (i'm in ur spectator tab btw)
15:16 < omnomnOMINOUS> the little thing at the bottom right
15:16 < Kimtruck> yeah
15:16 < Kimtruck> faith vs regen?
15:16 < omnomnOMINOUS> faith i think is one of the strongest amulets in the game? someone else can correct me if i'm wrong
15:16 < omnomnOMINOUS> but being able to use god powers more is really strong
15:23 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Warrior (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by a death yak on Lair:6, with 39052 points after 16991 turns and 1:16:05. [cbro]
15:23 < Kimtruck> dumb way to die
15:24 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah eventually you get a sense of what fights you can take and what fights you run from
15:25 < omnomnOMINOUS> often when you run away some of the pack will lose you; don't be afraid to run all the way to an upstairs as long as the monsters aren't faster than you
15:27 < odiv> I criminally underuse god powers.
15:27 < odiv> Which is probably partially why Vehumet is so awesome.
15:27 < zackoid> Kimtruck: is that the third straight lair:6?
15:28 < odiv> Kim will be our secret weapon.
15:29 < Kimtruck> zackoid, I think so? 
15:29 < Kimtruck> is that unusual?
15:30 < zackoid> yeah, though not supremely.  the last level of branches is usually a difficulty spike.
15:31 < zackoid> the unusual part is that there aren't d:3 and d:4 deaths mixed in, given your amount of time with the game
15:31 < omnomnOMINOUS> ^
15:31 < Kimtruck> I think I've had 1 d2 and 1 d4
15:31 < omnomnOMINOUS> the early parts of the dungeon actually make up a huge percentage of deaths
15:31 < Kimtruck> everything else has been d:12 or Lair
15:32 < zackoid> maybe the bot doesn't report all deaths anymore
15:32 < zackoid> i noticed it's not reporting starts
15:33 < zackoid> some lair:6 endings are way more deadly than the rest of lair, too.
15:33 < Kimtruck> can I find a list of every run I've made somewhere?
15:35 < zackoid> there's a website but it appears to be broken currently
15:35 < zackoid> !!lg Kimtruck s=place
15:35 < OCTOTROG> 9 games for Kimtruck: 3x Lair:6, D:5, D:4, D:2, D:7, D:8, D:12
15:35 < zackoid> or you can use the bots.
15:36 < Kimtruck> yeah, so it went D:12, then 2 and 4, then 7 and 8, then 3 Lairs
15:36 < zackoid> movin' on up
15:36 < zackoid> !!lg Kimtruck -log
15:36 < OCTOTROG> 9. kimtruck, XL13 MiBe, T:16991: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/morgue-kimtruck-20161101-192318.txt
15:37 < Kimtruck> so how would you guys recommend I go? should I go deeper in the dungeon, come back up for Lair, and then go even further up for Mines? 
15:37 < Kimtruck> or should I keep on doing what I've been doing and hit Lair as soon as I clear the level where one can find its door?
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah i usually jump into lair and/or orc as soon as i see them
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> but! i often back up out of their last level
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> as soon as it starts looking scary
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> then when i'm stronger i go back and clear their last levels
15:38 < zackoid> i usually do d:9 or d:10, then lair.  in general you have the right idea, but it's important to be flexible if you are struggling.  they've changed the meta a bit lately so it's not as flexible as it used to be
15:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> last level of orc has some nice shops
15:39 < zackoid> ??hyperelliptic
15:39 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot
15:39 < zackoid> that's the basic idea.
15:40 < Kimtruck> "get Rune"
15:40 < Kimtruck> ??rune
15:40 < OCTOTROG> rune[1/2]: Mystic keys (and status symbols) - you need at least three to enter Zot. They can be found at the end of some (but not all) dungeon branches, in Abyss:3-5, or in certain levels in Pandemonium. Runes are permanent, weightless once picked up, and tracked outside of inventory.
15:40 < Hildebrand> bot doesnt seem to be reporting :(
15:40 < zackoid> that means to finish those branches.  you need 3 runes in order to enter zot, the branch where the mcguffin is
15:40 < omnomnOMINOUS> oh yeah, also whether or not you have poison resistance sometimes affects how confident you can be when entering lair
15:41 < Hildebrand> no rP makes lair fun
15:42 < zackoid> Kimtruck: i don't see any obvious strategic mistakes in that last log.  training is fine, might be worth talking about ranged weapons after you've hit min delay.  dive order is fine.  have you used brothers in arms ever?  it's very expensive in terms of piety but also the best panic button in the game
15:42 < zackoid> also, do you grok the downside to berserking?  status effects can be non-obvious because of turn based.
15:42 < Hildebrand> i tend to spam trog hand the most, bia if its a real oh s* moment, and zerker rage when i just gotta clear a room
15:43 < Hildebrand> nothing like entering v5, popping all three, and watching everything die
15:43 < Hildebrand> ??cpa
15:43 < OCTOTROG> crystal plate armour[1/2]: 14AC, 23ER.
15:43 < Hildebrand> needs more that too
15:44 < Hildebrand> hrmm, bot no report my death?
15:45 < Kimtruck> zackoid, no, never used it. I also regularly forget to use wands
15:45 < Hildebrand> to a ghost, sigh
15:45 < Kimtruck> yeah the slow/exh can be brutal
15:45 < Kimtruck> I try to reserve Beserking for not-quite-panicking-yet 
15:45 < zackoid> i think they changed the threshold for notability for the bots, but i thought johnstein was going around that
15:45 < Kimtruck> and mainly rely on Hand of Trog since I can usually afford the Hunger penalty
15:46 < zackoid> berserking is best to take down single enemies, preferably somewhere where the noise won't draw any more.  
15:46 < zackoid> trog's hand is good but regen only makes a small difference in a single fight
15:47 < Kimtruck> I tend to beserk if I've got a large crowd of relatively high-level enemies in a hallway
15:47 < Kimtruck> just so I can cut through them while minimizing my HP loss
15:47 < zackoid> that's probably a good time to run away instead, because the berserk might run out halfway through, and then you're in trouble
15:48 < omnomnOMINOUS> running away is the best ability in the game
15:49 < Kimtruck> so how can you run away from quick enemies like demons or hoppy frogs? 
15:49 < Kimtruck> or do you just not?
15:49 < zackoid> i'm of the (unusual? possibly wrong) opinion that once you can get to lair, playing berserkers just teaches bad habits.  it says when the going gets tough, HULK OUT when most of the time the right answer is FLEE!  FLEE FOR YOUR LIFE!
15:49 < omnomnOMINOUS> sometimes you can't run away
15:49 < zackoid> fast things you can't run very far from, but you can back up or take upstairs so that at least nobody else will join the party
15:49 < omnomnOMINOUS> so you can use a haste or teleport or blink or something
15:50 < Kimtruck> ok
15:50 < Kimtruck> let's say I want to stop playing berserker
15:50 < Kimtruck> any recs for a next class?
15:50 < Hildebrand> basically, zackoid leads a life of no fun
15:50 < zackoid> or you can call a summon and block a hallway with it so they can't chase you
15:50 < zackoid> i may or may not have been part of a team who's uniforms were emblazoned with Team No Fun.
15:50 < Kimtruck> my work Slack icon is the No Fun robot
15:51 < Kimtruck> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/731/143/3e3.jpg
15:51 < zackoid> Kimtruck: gargoyle or minotaur fighter probs
15:51 < zackoid> note that you don't start with a god, you have to find an altar.
15:51 < odiv> Is the bot not reporting every milestone anymore?
15:51 < odiv> on cbro?
15:51 < zackoid> i think not
15:52 < odiv> I think there was a channel that both bots shared, right?
15:52 < odiv> or was it just msgs?
15:52 < greynaab> Stop playing berserker???  Trog is not very happy
15:52 < odiv> Kimtruck: DrCj!
15:52 < odiv> (though probably not really)
15:52 < zackoid> i don't see any cbro+ announcements at all.
15:53 < zackoid> Kimtruck: gargoyles are fun because they have complete immunity to poison and get tons of AC naturally.  downside is they are less versatile and have less HP than Mi.
15:57 < odiv> for a caster DEFE is pretty good actually.
15:57 < Kimtruck> so maybe a gargoyle melee?
15:58 < odiv> Though Dr is nice because then you don't have to worry about armour for a hybrid
15:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> if you're interested in a god that is like trog but lets you use magic, okawaru is a good option
15:58 < odiv> Hill Orc Monk of Makhleb is fun
15:58 < odiv> and orcs are good at hitting things with axes.
15:58 < zackoid> Kimtruck: don't listen to odiv.
15:58 < odiv> what
15:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> lol
15:58 < odiv> HOMo of Makhleb is super great!
15:58 < odiv> !apt ho
15:58 < OCTOTROG> HO: Fighting: 2, Short: 0, Long: 1, Axes: 3!, Maces: 1, Polearms: 1, Staves: -1, Slings: -1, Bows: -1, Xbows: -1, Throw: -1, Armour: 1, Dodge: -2, Stealth: -1, Shields: 1, UC: 1!, Splcast: -3, Conj: 0, Hexes: 0, Charms: -1, Summ: 0, Nec: 0, Tloc: -2, Tmut: -3, Fire: 1, Ice: -1, Air: -2, Earth: 0, Poison: -1, Inv: 3!, Evo: 0, Exp: 0, HP: 1, MP: 0
15:59 < zackoid> yes i agree but she's played like 6 games of MiBe.  keep it simple.
15:59 < odiv> 3 invocations! 3 axes!
15:59 < Kimtruck> chainmail on d2, gorgeous
15:59 < odiv> HP on kill is pretty sweet for simple
15:59 < odiv> but yeah, I guess Gr is probably better for immunities
15:59 < zackoid> also Mo is a terrible background
16:00 < odiv> Yeah, there's probably better for an HO of Makhleb.
16:01 < odiv> !lg odiv won HO
16:01 < OCTOTROG> 3. odiv the Axe Maniac (L27 HOMo of Beogh), escaped with the Orb and 3 runes on 2015-03-19 16:12:41, with 1632916 points after 74367 turns and 7:04:09.
16:01 < odiv> does that work?
16:01 < zackoid> !!lg . won HO--
16:01 < OCTOTROG> 5. zackoid the Axe Maniac (L27 HOMo of Qazlal), escaped with the Orb and 3 runes on 2016-04-02 19:23:10, with 1631605 points after 81381 turns and 4:52:07.
16:01 < odiv> look at my time!
16:01 < odiv> I really need to speed up.
16:02 < zackoid> that game i deliberately set out to play as fast as possible and it still took me 5 hours.
16:02 < zackoid> a normal game would be like 9.  i'm really really slow.
16:02 < Kimtruck> ??flail
16:02 < OCTOTROG> flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; +0 acc / 10 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A mace with a short chain connecting the head to the haft.
16:02 < Kimtruck> ??mace
16:02 < OCTOTROG> mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 8 dam / 1.4 base delay / 0.7 min delay). A short club with a metal head.
16:03 < odiv> ^whereis Kimtruck
16:03 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Cudgeler (L6 MiBe), a worshipper of Trog, is currently on D:3 after 1905 turns. [cbro]
16:03 < zackoid> Kimtruck: you can also see that information in game.  open the inventory and select the letter of the weapon
16:03 < zackoid> it will also tell your current swing speed, iirc
16:03 < odiv> hey neckro and johnstein: any idea why we're not getting all announces from cbro? was it turned off in anticipation of tournament flood?
16:03 < zackoid> or at least the skill vs mindelay
16:06 < neckro> uh... I haven't touched anything
16:06 < neckro> I was intending to give the bot some attention tonight though
16:07 < neckro> for the first time in forever
16:08 < zackoid> i know there was some talk about changing what gets reported upstream, but i thought it hadn't happened yet.
16:08 < neckro> johnstein might have messed with something, basically octotrog just parrots whatever rotatell sez
16:13 < Kimtruck> first go at a caster lasted about 20 turns\
16:14 < zackoid> that is pretty normal.
16:14 < odiv> I was also intending to give the bot some attention tonight.
16:14 < odiv> If you know what I'm saying.
16:15 < odiv> If you do know what I'm saying, please tell me.
16:15 < Kimtruck> no matter how you choose to parse that, it probably includes an increased risk for carpal tunnel!
16:16 < neckro> people love machines in 2016 a.d.
16:17 < Hildebrand> hmmm, thats a lovely combo
16:17 < Hildebrand> the elf twins and a ghost
16:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> hildebrand, i ran into your ghost!
16:46 < omnomnOMINOUS> Hildebrand's ghost screams in joy, "As in life, so in death: Kill! Kill!! Kill!!!"
16:47 < Hildebrand> good ghost
18:09 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Covert (L11 OpEn), worshipper of Dithmenos, shot by an orc knight (bolt) on Orc:2, with 7322 points after 10940 turns and 0:40:15. [cbro]
20:18 < odiv> grr, since switchhhhhing to wifi my wireless kb has been        terrible
20:18 < odiv> see what I mean?
20:18 <@ZureaL> are we no longer announcing milestones in here?
20:18 <@ZureaL> like unique kills, games starting, etc?
20:19 < odiv> nlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyythe ones in      ##crawl looks liikke
20:19 < advil> they might have cut announcements in ##crawl
20:19 < odiv> usuallly the not significant milestones get passeed to octotrog via  special channel.
20:20 < odiv> I don't know why that's not working
20:20 < odiv> neckro hasn't changed anything.
20:20 < odiv> maybe johnstein needs to update something.
20:22 < odiv> God, fuck this keyboard.
20:47 < Hildebrand> johnstein and neckro need to get together and figure it out
21:18 < OCTOTROG> zureal the Cleaver (L13 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by a catoblepas on Lair:5, with 26671 points after 17704 turns and 1:02:12. [cbro]
21:18 <@ZureaL> that's a first
21:22 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Covert (L12 OpAs), worshipper of Dithmenos, demolished by a meliai (a +0 hand axe) on Lair:4, with 13363 points after 13544 turns and 0:47:02. [cbro]
22:05 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Covert (L11 OpEn), worshipper of Dithmenos, mangled by an eight-headed hydra on Lair:1, with 10507 points after 12780 turns and 0:42:15. [cbro]
23:01 < johnstein> hmm. announcements should be the same
23:01 < johnstein> I will look into it
23:02 < johnstein> looks ok from a cursory scan
23:02 < johnstein> I will dig into it later
23:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/omnomnOMINOUS/omnomnOMINOUS.txt what should i be training next? i assume i want more skill in armor so i can wear pearl dragon armor?
23:58 < omnomnOMINOUS> is the +11 hand crossbow worth investing skill points into?
--- Day changed Wed Nov 02 2016
00:05 < zackoid> johnstein: definitely not reporting anything but deaths in here
00:06 < omnomnOMINOUS> (oh hm, or is PDA going to make me too unstealthy?)
00:07 < johnstein> !lm mfc cv=0.19
00:07 < OCTOTROG> 180. [2016-11-02 02:54:53] omnomnOMINOUS the Jinx (L11 VpEn of Dithmenos) entered a Labyrinth on turn 11316. (Lair:3)
00:07 < johnstein> I bet I forgot to update Rotatelljr
00:07 < advil> PDA is very good but it is slightly heavier than you'd want on a VpEn
00:07 < johnstein> I bet 0.18 works ok
00:10 < advil> it's also extraordinarily rare to have found it by lair 3
00:11 < omnomnOMINOUS> i have pearl dragon scales
00:11 < omnomnOMINOUS> only 2 enchant armour scrolls though
00:11 < advil> I think they changed how that works
00:11 < omnomnOMINOUS> (i found the scales in a minotaur labyrinth)
00:11 < advil> there's only one level, and scales = old armour
00:11 < advil> no more hides
00:12 < advil> so I haven't double checked to be sure this is exactly true, but PDA = PDS
00:12 < omnomnOMINOUS> wait really?
00:16 < advil> yeah, I'm sure about scales in 0.19, just not 100% they didn't tweak any stats
00:18 < advil> %%git ba71d7cf505c
00:18 < OCTOTROG> PleasingFungus * 0.19-a0-1848-gba71d7c: Rename: dragon armour -> dragon scales (4 weeks ago, 49 files, 215+ 191-) https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/ba71d7cf505c
00:18 < omnomnOMINOUS> ah ok
00:19 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah so i'm not sure whether i should stick with the stealthy stabbiness or maybe pivot into long blades and armor, or something entirely different
00:20 < advil> and
00:20 < advil> %%git cd7d164f1251
00:20 < OCTOTROG> PleasingFungus * 0.19-a0-1847-gcd7d164: Remove hides (4 weeks ago, 44 files, 153+ 422-) https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/cd7d164f1251
00:20 < omnomnOMINOUS> ah makes sense
00:20 < advil> well a Vp does well pivoting into long blades but I think you're in a position where you need to stick with stealth for the time being
00:21 < advil> what do the scales do to your stealth when you wear them?
00:21 < advil> your Str also seems a bit low to me for PDA
00:22 < omnomnOMINOUS> right now i have Stlth  ++++++++++, wearing the scales Stlth  ++++++++..
00:22 < advil> yeah, I probably wouldn't wear that right now
00:22 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah i wouldn't swap to PDA immediately
00:22 < advil> it'd be a while
00:23 < advil> probably more importantly I expect it will kill your spell fail rates for the foreseeable future
00:23 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah for sure
00:24 < omnomnOMINOUS> would it make sense to start training long blades and armor, or keep training hexes and stealth (currently 15 and 12 respectively)?
00:25 < advil> do you have a good long blade?
00:25 < omnomnOMINOUS> nope!
00:25 < omnomnOMINOUS> there is a scimitar of freezing lying around somewhere
00:26 < advil> that's not bad, if you want to change over I'd say that's a good enough weapon to start
00:28 < omnomnOMINOUS> nods
00:29 < advil> armour maybe don't focus yet, it's unclear to me when PDA would become viable on a VpEn of dith
00:30 < advil> though that's so rare to find you might do it on those grounds.  but it really would be more of an endgame armour even still
00:30 < omnomnOMINOUS> i see
00:30 < advil> you need more str, and a whole bunch of armour skill
00:30 < advil> I'd probably fsim it if it were my char
00:30 < advil> well not fsim it exactly, test in wizard mode offline
00:31 < advil> for comparison my VpEn ended the game in +5 leather, so basically what you're wearing now
00:31 < advil> sorry, +3 leather!
00:31 < advil> so worse than you have now
00:32 < advil> !lg . vpen won -log
00:32 < OCTOTROG> 1. advil, XL27 VpEn, T:113523: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/advil/morgue-advil-20150502-144215.txt
00:32 < omnomnOMINOUS> ah ok!
00:32 < advil> I went long blades also
00:33 < advil> my air magic strat there looks a bit silly tbh, don't do that
00:34 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah this is useful to see
00:35 < advil> !lg zackoid vpen won -log
00:35 < OCTOTROG> 1. zackoid, XL27 VpEn, T:108474: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20151122-041117.txt
00:35 < zackoid> mine apparently finished the game in a robe.
00:35 < advil> zackoid's may be a better point of comparison because it is dith
00:35 < zackoid> though it was +5, and had an AC buckler.
00:36 < zackoid> and ozo's wasn't crap.  and haste, mass confusion and phase shift existed :(
00:36 < omnomnOMINOUS> hehe
00:36 < advil> true, I suspect this sort of character is just weaker in 0.19
00:37 < zackoid> yeah light armour melee killdudes is gonna be pretty tough now
00:37 < zackoid> especially in zot
00:38 < zackoid> omnomnOMINOUS: is your hexes skill already 15?
00:38 < advil> well maybe learning tornado would make sense now!
00:38 < omnomnOMINOUS> yes
00:39 < zackoid> are you training it for something besides power?
00:39 < omnomnOMINOUS> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/omnomnOMINOUS/omnomnOMINOUS.txt
00:39 < omnomnOMINOUS> umm i just switched off training it; now i just have fighting / long blades / dodging on
00:40 < zackoid> if you have invis castable you probably want to work on some other stuff for awhile yeah
00:40 < omnomnOMINOUS> yeah invis is super castable
00:42 < omnomnOMINOUS> (thanks for the advice, everyone =)
00:54 < johnstein> let me know if milestones get announced again

06:56 < OCTOTROG> lair[1/2]: Accessed from the main dungeon somewhere between levels 8 and 11. Six levels deep (eight in 0.18-). The lair is full of "natural" critters such as rats, snakes, and yaks. One of Swamp/Shoals and one of Snake/Spider appears there, as well as Slime, and there is a relatively hard vault on Lair:8. The petting zoo of Crawl, if petting zoos had hydras.
06:57 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the Basher (L11 MiBe), worshipper of Trog, slain by an unseen horror on D:10, with 7867 points after 9604 turns and 0:40:28. [cbro]
06:58 < Kimtruck> ??unseen horror
06:58 < OCTOTROG> unseen horror[1/5]: "These creatures are usually unseen by the eyes of most, and those few who have seen them would rather not have." Moves like a bat, and invisible. A purple x if you can see invisible. The bane of mages and EV fighters everywhere.
07:14 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L1 MiBe) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
07:35 < Kimtruck> woulda survived had I thought to close doors, now that I read more about unseen horrors
07:35 < Kimtruck> learning about fleeing as a berserker: lessons learned too late
08:46 < zackoid> doors are the most overpowered item in the game!  slightly ahead of nets.
09:08 < kimtrucks> is johnstein's server down for anyone else?
09:10 < zackoid> seems so
09:12 < kimtrucks> I briefly have no work to do
09:12 < kimtrucks> brb need to gently sob at lack of crawl
09:31 < zackoid> you could start a game on one of the other servers in desperation
09:38 < greynaab> i just sent Johnstein a text to let him know about CBRO
09:42 < kimtrucks> danke
10:49 < odiv> Did Kim win yet?
10:49 < odiv> :D
10:52 < odiv> ^whereis
10:52 < OCTOTROG> odiv the Destroyer (L11 DrCj), a worshipper of Vehumet, saved on Lair:2 on 2016-09-16 after 13688 turns. [cbro]
10:52 < odiv> I should join ##crawl
10:52 < odiv> and maybe the SA one
10:52 < odiv> which network again?
10:56 < neckro> irc.freenode.net
10:56 < neckro> there's also an #octolog there which is where the cbro+ stuff comes from
10:57 < odiv> k thanks.
10:57 < odiv> I don't think I'm there right now?
10:57 < odiv> doesn't seem like it
10:57 < odiv> Now I have to look up irssi stuff again. :P
11:02 < kimtrucks> odiv well berotato is down today
11:02 < kimtrucks> :(
11:02 < odiv> :(
11:03 < kimtrucks> plan for this run, if I survive to Lair, is to back out of lair after L:5, go down to D:11 (if the Lair entrance wasn't there), then do first few levels of Mine, back out, then try to complete L:6
11:03 < odiv> Mine is only 2 levels now.
11:03 < odiv> if you see a sorc/warlord/high priest usually gtfo
11:04 < kimtrucks> I'm also really liking Maces/Flails for tackling the Hydras problem

11:12 < zackoid> heh
11:12 < zackoid> there's a reddit thread where everyone is freaking out thinking it's shut down permanently
11:12 < zackoid> which i guess is fair given the cao and cszo problems
11:13 < johnstein> zackoid. I don't k ow why, but that makes me kinda amused
11:15 < johnstein> "seems like there's large scale Internet backbone issues"
11:15 < johnstein> that, or someone forgot to put money in the BeRotato account jar
11:15 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L3 MiFi) killed Jessica. (D:2) [cbro+]

11:17 < odiv> Is there a spot for donations?
11:17 < odiv> Because it feels like you're going to get hammered for the tournament.

11:22 < zackoid> probably robin's gang.
11:22 < odiv> also known as free helmet.
11:22 < kimtrucks> playing Mi, no helmets for me
11:22 < kimtrucks> yup, Robin has appeared
11:23 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L6 MiBe) killed Robin. (D:4) [cbro+]

11:26 < zackoid> heh, this is what i'm talking about when i say berserkers teach you the wrong lessons.  pikel on D:4 is a Situation.  though he's melee-only.
11:26 < johnstein> odiv: cao is back. I'm not default
11:27 < odiv> oh, cool, that's good
11:27 < odiv> did they consult with you at all though?
11:27 < johnstein> pikel on D4 means we head to D5
11:27 < johnstein> kinda
11:27 < johnstein> i explained it wasn't a feasible solution
11:27 < odiv> I mean about tournament timing.
11:27 < johnstein> and kept nagging them to give me access to cao so I could free up space and upgrade to 0.19
11:27 < kimtrucks> ??sewer
11:27 < OCTOTROG> sewer[1/4]: The Sewers, initially conceived by Eino Keskitalo, who apparently had some to spare. They are timed and will disappear eventually if you do not enter them. Usually contains rats, kobolds, adders. A couple layouts have giant frogs.
11:28 < johnstein> timing? never
11:28 < odiv> That seems suboptimal.
11:28 < kimtrucks> relative sewer difficulty? that makes it sound breezy beautiful covergirl
11:28 < johnstein> but serveral were just assuming that cbro would handle it. i had to explain a few times that it could not
11:28 < lukano> sewers are pretty easy for a beserker
11:28 < odiv> sewer is usually fine
11:28 < odiv> don't stand in water to fight.
11:29 < kimtrucks> thanks guys
11:29 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L8 MiBe) entered a sewer. (D:5) [cbro+]
11:29 < odiv> and snorg or whoever sometimes hangs out there.
11:29 < zackoid> purgy.
11:30 < kimtrucks> already murdered purgy
11:30 < zackoid> but i think she already killed him this game.  the frogs are the biggest problem.
11:30 < odiv> ah
11:30 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L6 MiFi) killed Duvessa. (D:4) [cbro+]
11:31 < kimtrucks> sewers was easy, thanks guys. (it was mostly blocked off by deep sewage, dunno if that's common)
11:31 < zackoid> most of the layouts you can get around it if you take the long way, there's one that only part is accessible without flight or swimming
11:31 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L8 MiBe) killed the ghost of jordan the Grappler, a novice DrTm of Ru. (D:5) [cbro+]
11:32 < odiv> DrTm of Ru sounds like fun.
11:32 < odiv> I'm a big fuckin' dragon, I don't need any friends!
11:33 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L7 MiFi) killed Prince Ribbit. (D:5) [cbro+]
11:34 < kimtrucks> steam dragon on d5. I do not like this.
11:34 < kimtrucks>  The steam dragon is sucked into a shaft!
11:34 < kimtrucks> _The shaft crumbles and collapses.
11:34 < kimtrucks> uhhh
11:34 < kimtrucks> that's fine by me
11:35 < OCTOTROG> lukano (L8 MiFi) killed Sigmund. (D:6) [cbro+]

11:39 < kimtrucks> I'm playing Tournament Version 0.19
11:40 < odiv> cool
11:41 < zackoid> i don't think flight interacts with any traps
11:43 < odiv> hey slitherrr
11:43 <@slitherrr> sup
11:45 < kimtrucks> yo

12:24 < kimtrucks> ??Swamp
12:24 < OCTOTROG> swamp[1/3]: Accessed from the Lair somewhere between levels 2 and 5. Four levels deep. Expect watery terrain and hydras throughout. A decaying rune lies at the bottom, usually guarded by swamp dragons and hydras. As swamp drakes emit mephitic clouds, you may want to have poison resistance or enhanced mental clarity.
12:25 < kimtrucks> ??shambling mangrove
12:25 < OCTOTROG> shambling mangrove[1/1]: Slow moving but strong plants. They have a 20% chance of containing a band of yellow or red wasps or ravens (they don't count as summons), which will only be released after the shambling mangrove has taken enough damage. They can also use entangling {roots}.

12:41 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L4 MiBe) killed Robin. (D:2) [cbro+]
12:43 < kimtrucks> ??amulet of guardian spirit
12:43 < OCTOTROG> guardian spirit[1/1]: While wearing this amulet, damage you take is divided proportionally between MP and HP. Reduces magic to 0 on wearing. Note that a Deep Dwarf wearing this does not regain MP naturally. Other races that mutate slow healing 3 still do, however.
12:44 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L4 MiBe) killed the ghost of Yackwabbit the Skirmisher, an amateur DsMo. (D:3) [cbro+]
12:45 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L9 MfGl) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:9) [cbro+]
12:46 < johnstein> kimtrucks, D1 plate is rarely a good idea. but for MiBe it's an excellent idea, though I'd train armour some more
12:46 < johnstein> ??plate
12:46 < OCTOTROG> plate armour[1/1]: 10AC, 18ER.
12:46 < johnstein> ??er
12:46 < OCTOTROG> encumbrance rating[1/3]: A number representing how much armour harms your spellcasting, dodging, and melee accuracy. Units are "arbitrary units of encumbrance" (aue).
12:46 < johnstein> !stats mibe
12:46 < johnstein> !!stats mibe
12:47 < johnstein> !!stat mibe

12:47 < johnstein> !!gameinfo kimtruck
12:47 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck the L4 MiBe^Trog in D:3 (cbro tiles), T:1971, defenses: 17/9/0, stats: 27/4/10
12:47 < johnstein> so with 27 str, you can easily wear the plate without extra benefits
12:47 < johnstein> ??armour
12:47 < OCTOTROG> armour[1/4]: AC reduces incoming damage from most sources by 1d(AC+1)-1. This occurs before resistances. This can reduce it to 0. You might still get poisoned, banished etc. though. Some electric attacks (such as shock, lightning bolt, electric eel blasts) only check half of your AC. Impact damage from poison spells checks ac, the poison damage itself does not.
12:47 < johnstein> ??armour[2
12:47 < johnstein> ??armour[3
12:47 < OCTOTROG> armour[2/4]: Torment, smite, damnation, electrocution, and a handful of other abilities/effects ignore AC. The only player-castable damage spells that ignore AC are freeze, refrigeration, sticky flame, static discharge, pain, vampiric draining, Olgreb's Toxic Radiance, ignite poison, and agony. Note that all of these spells also ignore EV.
12:48 < OCTOTROG> armour skill[1/2]: Armour skill reduces the penalties associated with heavy armours, and increases the effectiveness of your armour by 1/22nd of its base value per level of skill.
12:48 < johnstein> but you will still have some of the penalties
12:48 < johnstein> but that should be outweighed by the AC and GDR
12:48 < johnstein> but I'd still make a point to train it a bit if you can spare the XP
12:48 < kimtrucks> it's currently at non-prioritized train
12:51 < johnstein> non-prioritized?

12:55 < kimtrucks> ??pain
12:55 < OCTOTROG> pain[1/3]: L1 necro spell, exclusive to the Book of Necromancy. Inflicts 1hp non-fatal damage on the caster. Does 1d(4 + pow/5) damage, with a limit of 25 power, and bypasses AC - but checks MR and only affects monsters without life protection, or players without torment immunity. You might've been looking for {pain brand}.
12:56 < kimtrucks> ??pain brand
12:56 < OCTOTROG> pain brand[1/2]: Brand which inflicts 1d(necromancy skill) extra damage on necro out of necro+1 successful hits. Does not affect those with rN (demons, undead, unliving, shadow dragons, death drakes, holies). (For the record, a monster's necromancy skill is HD/2, HD if undead or demonic, 0 if mindless/animal). Begins to edge out {elec brand} at 6 skill.

12:57 < johnstein> kimtrucks, pain is usually useless when you don't have necro sckill

15:33 < kimtrucks> ah
15:33 < kimtrucks> found the answer
15:33 < kimtrucks> no
15:33 < apoch> you are correct
15:34 < apoch> lair is not a rune branch
15:35 < kimtrucks> out of the lair
15:35 < kimtrucks> onto Mines

15:36 < zackoid> make sure to xv the new orcs
15:36 < zackoid> not all orcs are trash.
15:36 <@ZureaL> that's a nice weapon kimtrucks 
15:37 < kimtrucks> speaking of, that's a paladin-type orc
15:37 < zackoid> saint roka?
15:39 < kimtrucks> no, just a knight
15:39 < kimtrucks> oof
15:39 < kimtrucks> ??bardiche
15:39 < OCTOTROG> bardiche[1/1]: (polearms; -6 acc / 18 dam / 2.0 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). A long pole with an enormous, cleaving blade on one end. The largest polearm. Bardiches chop hydra heads.

16:07 < kimtrucks> the scary question of the hour:: do I open the runed door on Mines 2 after clearing rest of mines?
16:08 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L10 TeAE) killed Joseph. (D:7) [cbro+]
16:10 <@slitherrr> kimtrucks, the rewards may be grand! or they may be a banana
16:10 <@slitherrr> johnstein, do we know if ' is allowed in team names?
16:10 < kimtrucks> I'm less concerned about the reward than about the potential for getting my rear handed to me
16:10 < kimtrucks> runed doors have not historically contained presents
16:10 < johnstein> slitherrr: hm. I have no clue
16:11 < johnstein> kimtrucks: I'd probably open it. if you cleared mines you should be ok
16:11 < johnstein> mostly ok
16:11 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L11 TeAE) killed Grum. (D:9) [cbro+]
16:12 < kimtrucks> opened it
16:12 < kimtrucks> popped Brothers in Arm for first time but so far so good
16:12 < kimtrucks> ok, cleared the Mines entirely
16:14 < kimtrucks> any way to guarantee it's saved or should I just quit?
16:17 < kimtrucks> ??hyperelliptic
16:17 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot

16:19 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L11 TeAE) killed Erica. (D:11) [cbro+]
16:20 < kimtrucks> ^dump kimtruck
16:20 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
16:21 < zackoid> you should wear the MR+ ring and can drop the rpois ring as long as you have that cloak
16:21 < zackoid> you should use one of those ID scrolls on one of the wands of teleportation, it will tell you the # of charges, and using scrolls that are not-ID'd burns more than 1 charge per use
16:22 < zackoid> we should talk about acquirement before you go anywhere else.
16:23 < zackoid> and finally, now would be a good time to start boost a ranged attack of some kind
16:24 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L11 TeAE) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:10) [cbro+]
16:39 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L12 TeAE) killed Urug. (Lair:3) [cbro+]

16:45 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L13 TeAE) killed Sonja. (Lair:3) [cbro+]
16:47 < kimtrucks> zackoid: so I've accidentally read acquirement before
16:47 < kimtrucks> what should I know?
16:49 < zackoid> the most important thing is just that when you read it you have to decide what you want to acquire, you can't do anything or access any information while doing it
16:49 < zackoid> the second is that it's commonly referred to as the scroll of disappointment
16:49 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L13 TeAE) killed Harold. (Lair:4) [cbro+]
16:50 < zackoid> what you select depends mostly on what you already have and what you need.  usually an early one i'd select weapon, but trog gifts you weapons so that's not as important
16:50 < kimtrucks> my gorgeous +14 dire flail. Thanks Trog. Best Santa.
16:50 < zackoid> that is not an end-game weapon but it will do for now
16:50 < kimtrucks> jesus criminny how high do weapons get?!
16:51 < zackoid> normally +9 is the max for all weapons, randarts are allowed to go into the upper teens (very very rarely).
16:51 < zackoid> the issue is that with lots of skill, base weapon damage is much more important than enchantment (the +14), because it's multiplied by skill where enchantment is not
16:53 < zackoid> and a dire flail has relatively low base damage (13, the highest among maces is 17, and there are 1H weapons with as much or more dmg than the 2H dire flail
16:54 < zackoid> so that dire flail is an excellent weapon for the early game and for awhile, but trog will give you a great mace or eveningstar at some point that will be superior
16:54 < odiv> which mace is 17?
16:54 < odiv> ??maces
16:54 < OCTOTROG> maces & flails[1/2]: club (+3/5/1.3/0.6), whip (+2/6/1.1/0.5), hammer (+3/7/1.3/0.6), mace (+3/8/1.4/0.7), flail (+0/10/1.4/0.7), demon whip (+1/11/1.1/0.5), sacred scourge (+0/12/1.1/0.5), morningstar (-2/13/1.5/0.7), eveningstar (-1/15/1.5/0.7), dire flail (-3/13/1.3/0.6) [2], great mace (-4/17/1.7/0.7) [2], giant club (-6/20/1.7/0.7) [2], giant spiked club (-7/22/1.8/0.7) [2]
16:54 < zackoid> great.
16:54 < odiv> ah
16:54 < odiv> and -3 to -4 isn't crazy
16:54 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS the Zephyrmancer (L13 TeAE), worshipper of Vehumet, shot by Nessos (arrow) on Lair:5, with 29016 points after 22905 turns and 1:35:36. [cbro]
16:55 < zackoid> at high skill levels accuracy is not important i think
16:55 < zackoid> i didn't realize the dire flail is 0.6 speed, so it's not as crappy as i thought
16:56 < zackoid> maybe when i get home i'll FSIM it, rules of thumb on weapons have been wrong before
17:02 < kimtrucks> thanks zackoid
17:03 < kimtrucks> I think this is still in my first 15 runs. 
17:03 < kimtrucks> This is a pretty good run so far.
17:03 < kimtrucks> Just need to avoid getting cocky
17:05 < odiv> or get lucky!
17:08 < zackoid> anyway, as for acquirements i would go either wand or armour and expect garbage.  odiv will disagree.
17:08 < zackoid> doh, don't have parts showing in this channel.
17:08 < odiv> what?
17:08 < odiv> :P
17:31 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L12 DrCj) killed Harold. (Lair:2) [cbro+]

17:55 < zackoid> someone give me a good late-game monster for FSIM
17:55 < roj> I don't think I've ever seen one.
17:55 < roj> (a late game monster)
17:55 < roj> Some sort of... lightning... demon?
17:56 < zackoid> a blizzard demon, you must mean, since you have clearly been do the post-game content.
17:56 < zackoid> probably many many times.
17:56 < roj> Heh.

18:21 <@slitherrr> lol ok
18:23 < zackoid> so dispater is the first of 10 mobs i've tried FSIM with 
18:23 < zackoid> where a +14 dire flail is not at least slightly better than a +9 great mace
18:23 < zackoid> even at 20 skill, and 27 fighting
18:24 < roj> That sort of annoys me about DCSS, how the tradeoffs dissapear at higher weapon levels.
18:24 < zackoid> and this is just fsim so i didn't build the character up properly, but everything i can think of that i didn't account for makes the dire flail better, not worse
18:25 < zackoid> so that is very suprising to me
18:25 < zackoid> i expected it to be better than a +0 great mace, but only 5 enchantment overriding 4 base damage makes no sense to me
18:26 < zackoid> roj: the skill investment is the tradeoff, if i'm understanding you right
18:26 < roj> I more meant the whole +acc but less damage or vice versa within a single class.
18:27 < roj> Eventually those dissappear, if the writeup I read is correct, and maces are the best clubs and something is the best longblade, etc.
18:27 < zackoid> yeah, people generally ignore accuraccy entirely.  but they are also generally wrong.
18:28 < zackoid> like this test does not fit with the conventional wisdom at all
18:28 < zackoid> though dbro is out of date, it could be a bug
18:28 < zackoid> fun fact, once during a tournament that were a bug where player weapon damge was doubled
18:28 < zackoid> and nobody noticed for a week
18:28 < zackoid> that's how complicated DCSS combat is.
18:29 < roj> Well, they're all such bad asses.
18:29 < zackoid> or how complicated + how variable, i should say
18:29 < OCTOTROG> roj (L1 OpBe) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
18:30 < zackoid> octopodes are not complicated or variable though.  they just die.
18:33 <@slitherrr> ??great mace
18:33 < OCTOTROG> great mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; -4 acc / 17 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). An enormous metal war club, of great cumbrousness. The largest mace most playable races can wield. Ogres and Trolls can wield giant (spiked) clubs too.
18:33 <@slitherrr> ??dire flail
18:33 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.
18:36 <@slitherrr> zackoid, what strength, btw?
18:38 < zackoid> that was a mibe, i think like 27 str, not enough dex for end game
18:39 < roj> yeah, I don't even know what that means not enough dex for end game.
18:40 < roj> I am not a heavy tourney contributor.
18:40 <@slitherrr> do you still have the FSIM up? could you do it again with a GSC?
18:40 < roj> I DO look at every piece of armor I find, sooooo
18:41 < zackoid> i'd need to stat up a character that could weild it
18:41 < zackoid> wield.
18:41 <@slitherrr> ogbe?
18:42 < zackoid> i'd have to delete the current one which i'm not ready to do yet

19:05 < zackoid> free helmet!
19:05 < zackoid> also you want that flail.  and to wear that helmet.
19:06 < roj> e had no flail.
19:06 < roj> A friend of his did.
19:06 < roj> And I'm an octopode and can't wear the helm
19:06 < zackoid> oh right, only hats
19:06 < zackoid> which is ridiculous
19:07 < zackoid> octopodes have enough clothing problems.
19:08 < zackoid> you can also manage autopickups with \ nethack style
19:09 < zackoid> do you have any scroll stacks?
19:09 < zackoid> now would be a good time to read then on D:2

19:11 < zackoid> ??right of teleportation[2
19:12 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled right_of_teleportation[2] in my learndb.

19:12 < roj> Okay.

19:14 < zackoid> yeah, the worst things are like noise and teleportation which can't hurt as much a level with few enemies

19:49 < Kimtruck> oh hey trog gave me a great mace
19:49 < Kimtruck> let's see how it'll so
19:49 < Kimtruck> ??great mace
19:49 < OCTOTROG> great mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; -4 acc / 17 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). An enormous metal war club, of great cumbrousness. The largest mace most playable races can wield. Ogres and Trolls can wield giant (spiked) clubs too.
19:50 < zackoid> Kimtruck: contradicting everything i said earlier, i did some simulator tests and the dire flail is probably better.  what's the stats on the great mace?
19:50 < Kimtruck> +1, protection
19:50 < zackoid> also that is an amazing ring, you should start training invocations for it
19:50 < zackoid> err evocations, not invoke
19:50 < zackoid> yeah dire flail is way better than that
19:51 < Kimtruck> I'm being treated VERy nicely by RNG this run
19:51 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L6 VpEn) killed Sigmund. (D:4) [cbro+]
19:51 < Kimtruck> ^dump kimtruck
19:51 < OCTOTROG> http://crawl.beRotato.org/crawl/morgue/kimtruck/kimtruck.txt [cbro]
19:54 < Kimtruck> that's a lot of centaurs. suspect there's a named centaur dude at the other end of them
19:54 < Kimtruck> ??velocity
19:54 < OCTOTROG> velocity[1/2]: Vorpal ranged weapons are suffixed with 'velocity'. It gives 20% bonus damage and does not overwrite the ammunition brand.
19:54 < Kimtruck> oh jesus
19:54 < Kimtruck> RNG is good to me
19:57 < Kimtruck> ??rod
19:57 < OCTOTROG> rod[1/4]: Contains a spell. Wield and Evoke to cast it. Uses an internal mana pool which recharges gradually over time, even if not wielded. A scroll of recharging increases a rod's limit and enchantment by 1d2 (up to a max of 17 and +9 respectively), and (always) recharges its mp to full. See {rods} for a list of types.
19:59 < Kimtruck> D14 is just ugly thing fort
19:59 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L7 VpEn) killed Eustachio. (D:5) [cbro+]
20:01 < omnomnOMINOUS> rods can be pretty good if you're training up evocations for evoking invis from your ring anyway
20:04 < Kimtruck> hm
20:04 < Kimtruck> good to know
20:04 < Kimtruck> thanks
20:04 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L15 MiBe) reached level 15 of the Dungeon. (D:15) [cbro+]
20:05 < zackoid> rods are usually worth training evocations for anyway, though it's more cognitive load to deal with

20:10 < OCTOTROG> kimtruck (L15 MiBe) killed Louise. (D:15) [cbro+]

20:11 < OCTOTROG> hyperelliptic[1/1]: Lair -> D:12 -> Orc -> D:15 -> S:3 -> maybe other S:3 -> get rune -> Vaults:4 -> maybe get second rune -> Depths:5 -> get three runes -> Zot

20:14 < Kimtruck> I've heard tell that Shoals is now stupid hard
20:14 < Kimtruck> so I'
20:14 < Kimtruck> m going with Spider
20:15 < zackoid> they are all noticably harder than what you just finished
20:15 < omnomnOMINOUS> MR and a way to deal with projectiles is good for shoals; poison resistance is mandatory for spider. invisibility helps a ton in shoals (put your cursor over enemies with x and examine them with v, to check if they can see invisible)
20:15 < zackoid> be sure to check for special abilities among the spider hordes
20:21 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L8 VpEn) killed Prince Ribbit. (D:7) [cbro+]

21:24 < omnomnOMINOUS> getting to the last floor of a rune branch already is still extremely good though
21:25 < johnstein> Kimtruck, L16 is usually min level for me to attempt a final floor of a rune branch. I will often save it for later after clearing 1-3 of the other one or doing more D
21:25 < johnstein> but I'm a wimp
21:25 < Kimtruck> johnstein good to know!
21:26 < OCTOTROG> apoch (L9 DsCK) killed Pikel. (D:8) [cbro+]

21:40 < OCTOTROG> holy wrath[1/1]: Increases damage by 75% on average against undead and demons. These folks also cannot wield it. Does not hate evil creatures which are not undead or demons. This means that holy wrath is ineffective against hell knights, and some worshippers of evil gods can wield it.

21:40 < roj> I'm not switching to halbers for that.
21:41 < OCTOTROG> omnomnOMINOUS (L9 VpEn) fell down a shaft to D:8. (D:7) [cbro+]

21:57 < Hildebrand> well, thats a new sewer layout
21:59 < Hildebrand> so zackoid, ring of stealth and ring of int are by far better for me than a +4 dex and {str+4 SInv} right?

22:02 < zackoid> no?
22:02 < roj> just wear all 8

22:02 < roj> oh heck yeah
22:03 < zackoid> int is almost worthless for a mibe.  only good for preventing stat death against stat drainers
22:03 < Hildebrand> was supposed to be a sarcastic question
22:04 < zackoid> that makes more sense
22:05 < roj> ??protection
22:05 < OCTOTROG> protection[1/1]: Bonus AC. On rings, anywhere from -6 to +6. On weapons, gives +7 AC for up to 5 turns when you successfully hit a monster that isn't {firewood}.

22:08 < roj> I dunno as I should be doing advanced play, here.
22:08 < roj> I do like wearing all teh rings

22:10 < zackoid> protection is actually useful for octopodes

22:12 < Hildebrand> oh, dumb quesiton

22:23 < Hildebrand> ok, another dumb question
22:23 < Hildebrand> it feels like they have changed the skill point aquistion for fighting, is that true?
22:26 < johnstein> ?
22:26 < johnstein> you mean for auto skilling?
22:26 < johnstein> I don't think anyone does that
22:26 < zackoid> the aura means it's friendly, they use auras instead of smily faces now
22:26 < zackoid> Hildebrand: you meant the apt?
22:27 < Hildebrand> i mean, i have 8.3 levels in fighting, 12.3 in axes
22:28 < Hildebrand> it used to be a fair bit more balanced leveling between those
22:28 < Hildebrand> ??apt mi
22:28 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled apt_mi in my learndb.
22:28 < zackoid> never used auto skilling
22:29 < Hildebrand> not using auto skilling, just doing the old fighting+axes, then after getting some points in that, adding some armour and dodge
22:29 < roj> I will futz with priorities but it's still mostly auto skill.
22:30 < zackoid> i don't think anything changed with that
22:30 < Hildebrand> whats the command to pull up the aptitudes again?

22:30 < OCTOTROG> fighting[1/1]: The Fighting skill gives you a bonus to accuracy and damage in melee and ranged, and improves your hit points by Fighting * (3/2 + XL/14) (see {hp}). Its effect on your damage is 0.83x the effect of weapon skill (not counting increases in attack speed), so if you want to hit hard then train it too.

22:45 < roj> ??wizardry
22:45 < OCTOTROG> wizardry[1/2]: Makes spellcasting less likely to fail. Comes in staff and ring form. Stacks, but not very well. Vehumet grants a similar boost to {destructive spells}, which stacks well with regular wizardry.

02:00 < omnomnOMINOUS> hmm... should i get the necronomnomnomnomnomicon or should i pain-brand my quick blade?
02:00 < omnomnOMINOUS> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/omnomnOMINOUS/omnomnOMINOUS.txt
02:03 < omnomnOMINOUS> i have excruciating wounds but it's not really easily castable yet; also i'm hoping to learn deflect missiles and dispel undead at some point and i don't have enough spell slots yet
02:10 < omnomnOMINOUS> oh it looks like i can't cast most of the powerful spells in the necrobook anyway as a vampire (and i can get similar benefits by going bloodless) so it sounds like pain brand is the obvious choice...
