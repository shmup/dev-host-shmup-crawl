16:21 < zackoid> shmup: are you making a graph of the worst addicted players
16:26 <@shmup> lol
16:26 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/ghost-of-the-week.txt
16:27 <@shmup> but i'm trying to filter out bots, is the thing. i keep a list and only have 2 in it. there is no good query at the moment. was talking in dev about it.
16:28 <@shmup> i'm also working on a thing for http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/
16:28 < zackoid> that is not a public directory
16:28 <@shmup> octo / log
16:29 <@shmup> i'm gonna add an input up top for regex filtering. will not output any of our log here by default.
16:29 <@shmup> i started fresh so no previous history in log
16:29 < zackoid> i mean i just get a login prompt
16:29 <@shmup> yes, u: octo p: log
16:30 <@shmup> it's nothing atm. pointless to link really
16:30 < zackoid> oh
16:31 <@shmup> i can always grep my own log but earlier when you forgot the git command, i wish i had a frontend to quickly regex/grep shit out
16:31 <@shmup> from here
16:41 < zackoid> what, you don't log all of our wonderful banter for posterity?
16:48 <@shmup> haha
16:48 <@shmup> well by principle i log everything irc related :P
16:49 <@shmup> this is just a new special log, located elsewhere with permissions to read, ignoring things like nick changes etc

21:20 <@shmup> zackoid: thoughts on http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/dev.php?search=git
21:21 <@shmup> i could make it so that i dont wrap the query in .* 
21:21 <@shmup> or i could leave it raw and just let the user do what is needed
21:21 <@shmup> aka they would need to .* around things, otherwise the pattern matching just returns the single pattern found in each line. not the whole line. . or i could revise that i guess
21:22 <@shmup> i could also give options to check like "dont search nicks"
21:31 < odiv> zackoid: Yeah, I just meant like what does your question mean?
21:31 < odiv> Obv you figured it out. :P

21:39 < zackoid> odiv: i ended up clearing them.  i just don't know how you survive if you don't.
21:42 < zackoid> shmup: so just a searchable log?  i don't see where the git happens
21:43 < odiv> Oh, you fuckin' book it. :P
21:44 < odiv> or you play tele roulette
21:44 < odiv> I should play again. I miss it.
21:51 < zackoid> but everything's gonna cut you off at the choke point
21:51 < zackoid> and tele is really dangerous since you have like a 40% chance of landing in the uncleared part

23:14 <@shmup> oh zackoid no i just wanted to grep _this chan_ and i could look at previous commands you've done, etc
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: tell me the diff bot searching abilities sometime
23:53 <@shmup> zackoid: i made another page to just grep git and list links to the raw source files (loads faster) but i'm not sure what all the search features are in botland
23:53 <@shmup> like you can search commit names? last commits? etc
23:56 < zackoid> i don't know that bot very well since i don't even know what it's called and don't know if there are any docs
23:56 < zackoid> one downside to having octotrog relay everything
23:57 < zackoid> there was a dblist entry that had basic help on all the bot operators but now i don't even remember what that was

00:04 < zackoid> ?!spen
00:04 < OCTOTROG> {SPEN}: <zackoid>	you sleep anything that you can sleep, you confuse anything you can confuse, you tukima anything with a weapon that you can tukima, you blind anything you can blind, you go invis against anything without sinv, in that order
00:04 < zackoid> i'm sure i was verbing tukima as a joke but it still hurts to read.
00:05 < zackoid> also i'd revise that because invis doesn't really go at the end, it depends.  invis has a lot of defensive benefits.
00:20 <@shmup> verbing things is nice all the time
00:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?search=slow
00:20 <@shmup> i can improve big time but if you have a thought let me know.. won't except patterns atm lol
00:22 <@shmup> things that are bad about linking to raw is line numbers are less useful :P i think i'll include regular link and [raw] after it
00:23 <@shmup> johnstein only once said "by johnstein"
00:23 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/git/?grep=johnstein
00:42 < johnstein> shmup: authentication required
03:23 < Rotatell> johnstein: Unstable branch on crawl.beRotato.org updated to: 0.19-a0-1068-g99dd0f4 (34)
08:53 <@shmup> johnstein: octo/log
08:59 < advil> maybe useful to restrict to just the main source directory
09:00 < advil> to have an option that does that I mean
09:01 < advil> e.g. if you search for "hellion" there's a ton of misc results that you may or may not want, but the key link w.r.t. the source is just mon-data.h
09:03 <@shmup> that's fair, you mean the crawl-ref/source dir right?
09:03 < advil> yeah
09:03 < advil> or I suppose another way to do it would be by file type
09:04 < advil> .h vs .c vs .des vs misc or something
09:04 < advil> since you often do want to exclude .h from a grep
09:05 <@shmup> hm. def more thought needed.
09:05 <@shmup> also how i'm parsing results is kinda fucked. grep returns information separated by : and i'm being lazy and splitting on : atm.
09:06 <@shmup> however if the result actually contains a :, i'm gonna be doing things _wrong_
09:06 < advil>  haha that explains what's going on with the .des results then
09:06 <@shmup> yeah haha
09:06 <@shmup> exactly
09:06 <@shmup> this was a 12a thing i started and shouldn't have (cause 12a)
09:07 < advil> also uh stupid-ish question, have you played with github's code search?
09:07 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=hellion
09:07 <@shmup> i also think it might be best to just let you use raw regex, however having to do .*foo.* all the time (99% of the time) could be annoying. maybe i could compensnate somehow.
09:07 < advil> not that doing your own thing is bad or anything
09:08 <@shmup> yeah really i use that and just grepping locally
09:08 <@shmup> but .. a few of my browsers for whatever reason, choke on github cause it loads the fancy result page w/ line nums and shit.
09:08 <@shmup> i cant explain why it loads so poorly for me if a large file
09:08 <@shmup> so i always prefer to see the raw result
09:09 <@shmup> honestly man, i dont even know why i did the git thing. i just wanted an irc log search lol
09:09 < advil> heh
09:09 <@shmup> then zackoid, very late, made a comment about "not seeing the git thing" and
09:09 <@shmup> unsure exactly what he wanted.. i started a thing
09:09 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/log/?search=%21lg
09:10 <@shmup> i just wanna do that sometimes to remind myself of syntax
09:10 <@shmup> i Learn By Example (or never learn cause i rely on examples all the time)
09:10 < advil> hmm
09:11 < advil> we should put the lg docs in the topic
09:11 < advil> I can't set it myself though
09:11 < advil> https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/docs/listgame.md
09:12 < advil> I do actually sometimes search the logs in crawl-dev for bot syntax too
09:17 < zackoid> shmup: i just meant the button said something about git on it, so i wasn't sure what i was looking at.  our i was hallucinating becuase i was tired.
09:58 < zackoid> advil: getting a lil' salty on the tavern huh
10:03 < advil> haha yes
10:03 < advil> it'll get ignored though probably
10:03 < advil> tavern is such a dysfunctional community
10:04 < advil> I get more and more fed up with it as time goes on

10:05 <@advil> hi :)
10:05 <@shmup> it did not say git on the button zackoid! lol
10:06 <@zackoid> advil: i agree and i stopped reading it for a long time.  but i think that particularly comment was just a n00b.
10:06 <@shmup> link?
10:06 <@shmup> to the advil-thread
10:06 <@advil> oh my saltiness is just a side-comment on a thread that was already split from something else
10:06 <@advil> zackoid: nago isn't a noob
10:06 <@advil> he used to be a blue name even
10:07 <@zackoid> ah i was referring to the guy who mentioned orb guardians to begin with
10:07 <@advil> lethediver is sort of maybe, if that's who you mean
10:07 <@advil> I kind of suspect lethediver is a sock
10:07 <@zackoid> i logged into the tavern for the first time ever yesterday, and almost posted a comment.  WHY THE HELL is the unread-thread text bolded, eye-searing bright red?
10:08 <@zackoid> heh you think that of everyone.
10:08 <@advil> well there's a continuous stream of semi-trolling noobs with weird strong opinions
10:08 <@advil> I guess crawl could just breed those
10:08 <@shmup> it is a nice looking phpBB forum
10:09 <@shmup> i never visit here, really. very very seldomly
10:09 <@advil> shmup https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=20967
10:10 <@advil> anyways that attitude about sequell is all over tavern, it annoys me
10:11 <@shmup> really? ha
10:11 <@shmup> > Where are the bot-queries-always-have-the-right-answers guys when they are really needed?
10:11 <@shmup> you are referring to that right?
10:11 <@zackoid> well it's true that just posting queries has a very low signal
10:11 <@advil> yeah
10:12 <@advil> it's true that there've been a few people who tended to use sequell queries incompetently in arguments and wouldn't stop
10:12 <@advil> bcadren was on iirc
10:12 <@zackoid> but by now people should be able to intuit what the data is actually saying, because the bias is the same one in most cases
10:12 <@advil> yeah
10:13 <@advil> some day I'm gonna import sequell data into some of the more sophisticated models we use in research
10:13 <@advil> it's not even as if the biases in the data can't be dealt with
10:14 <@zackoid> is there anything as powerful as player skill in the data you work with (that is not directly correlated with something easy to identify)?
10:14 <@shmup> that would be v interesting, advil 
10:16 <@advil> zackoid: probably not, but player skill should be correlated with a ton of easy things
10:16 <@advil> # games, # wins, for two
10:16 <@shmup> yeah
10:16 <@zackoid> it is DEFINITELY not correlated with games, heh
10:16 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained within wins
10:16 <@advil> and there is a lot of stuff around modeling variation between subjects
10:17 <@shmup> average num of runes obtained when obtaining runes (w/o win) in general
10:17 <@advil> I'm sure it correlates with # games, if you factor in individual differences
10:17 <@advil> there are very few people who could play hundreds of games without getting better in some way
10:18 <@zackoid> the guy who won shmup ghostkill award had 2000 in 3 months without winning.
10:18 <@zackoid> turns would be better, probably.
10:18 <@zackoid> maybe hours.
10:18 <@advil> well, but correlation has no commitment to there not being outliers
10:19 <@zackoid> yeah though i don't think that was really an extreme outlier.  bad players rack up games because they end so fast.
10:19 <@advil> and I would be surprised if even that guy didn't have some measurable improvement over those 2000 games
10:19 <@advil> just not improvement that involves winning
10:19 <@zackoid> and also most people, after they first win, get worse before they get better again i think.
10:19 <@advil> probably "skill" is fairly high dimensional
10:21 <@shmup> that person was likely a bot, also
10:21 <@advil> but I think you are thinking in too categorical terms :)
10:21 <@shmup> i kinda wish bots were allowed by required tagging in crawlrc heh
10:21 <@zackoid> i don't think that was a bot.
10:21 <@advil> I'm 95% sure that if you plotted # games and # wins, there'd be a clear linear correlation (even if that's not the best way to model it)
10:22 <@zackoid> well games vs wins would.  or do you mean skill vs games and wins
10:22 <@advil> well, I'm not sure that skill makes sense as a single dimensional-value
10:22 <@advil> but wins is a proxy for skill, presumably
10:22 <@zackoid> probably not.  i just meant that you can't win without playing another game
10:23 <@shmup> man
10:23 <@shmup> deep learning on some data would be fun

11:19 <@zackoid> well, 1.
11:23 <@zackoid> fortunately i looked at that before going into a half-hour diversion of looking up lava orc nutrition mechanics
16:50 <@zackoid> advil: R1 faculty sure are inbred huh
16:51 <@advil> probably
16:51 <@advil> it's worst at the top schools
16:51 <@advil> it's more like the top 10 in any given field are inbred
16:52 <@zackoid> i'm looking over where our faculty got their phds and it's the same handful of schools over and over.
16:52 <@zackoid> plus one santa cruz linguist, so i guess their linguistics department is better than the average there.
16:52 <@advil> yeah it's very godo
16:52 <@advil> *good
16:52 <@advil> (that's where I went)
16:53 <@zackoid> i saw a paper a few months ago that was using a network model for this and it verified that nobody hires from schools 'beneath' them, so at the top you can only hire for like 5 schools.
16:53 <@advil> probably the three ling departments with the best placement are MIT, UCSC, UMass Amherst
16:53 <@advil> maybe Stanford
16:53 <@advil> you've got all four I think?
16:54 <@zackoid> do we even have 4 linguistics faculty
16:54 <@advil> oh maybe no MIT
16:54 <@advil> 3 umass, one stanford, one (retired) UCSC
16:55 <@zackoid> uh shit i hope she retired in the last couple months
16:55 <@advil> I don't think so but I don't know the exact dates
16:56 <@zackoid> well shit.
16:56 <@zackoid> this should only be active faculty.
16:56 <@advil> she still has an appointment as a research associate
16:56 <@advil> http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/associates/gunlogson_christine/index.html
16:57 <@zackoid> ok, that's likely, this pool is all research + teaching staff.
17:00 <@zackoid> advil: since you were a product, is umass-boston a big thing or is the system just overwriting all umass schools with the first on the list
17:00 <@advil> umass boston is not a big thing
17:00 <@advil> "UMass" means UMass Amherst
17:01 <@advil> UMass Boston / UMass Lowell are ok local schools, lots of commuters / returning students, I think they might be R2s?
17:01 <@zackoid> i was suspicious because while i've heard of lowell i've never even heard of boston
17:01 <@advil> it's very unlikely that anyone who works at rochester has a Ph.D from UMass Boston
17:01 <@advil> (and no one in ling does)
17:01 <@zackoid> and a lot of the schools have really dumb names so i'm guessing some software is fucking it up
17:02 <@advil> I know someone who taught there through tenure and it was a shitty job
17:02 <@zackoid> heh one of them is a linguist
17:02 <@zackoid> and her CV says amherst.  bleh.
17:03 <@zackoid> actually 2/5 are linguists.  one more thing on the pile of corrections.
17:03 <@advil> haha good thing you know me!
17:04 <@zackoid> i did suspect something fishy but it's possible i would have been too drained of this crap to look it up if you hadn't provided an easy resource.
17:04 <@zackoid> so thanks.
17:05 <@advil> maybe this is why the dean's office always makes us give this stuff to them in like 3 different formats
17:07 <@advil> I think at least 3 people in your ling dept have degrees from UMass

17:20 <@zackoid> advil: is there any effort to make faculty have like perfectly standardized CV formats?
17:20 <@advil> haha no
17:20 <@advil> there's always some semi-standardized word template that they want us to use to convey the same information in addition to the CV though
17:21 <@advil> part if the issue is that bib standards vary by field

17:58 <@advil> well, I spent most of the afternoon doing bs administrative stuff too
17:58 <@advil> just from a desk in ottawa :-P
18:03 <@zackoid> are you writing up there?  you can't possibly have actual vacation time
18:03 <@advil> well, if you mean vacation time in a technical sense, keep in mind that most academics are on a 9 month salary
18:04 <@zackoid> yeah, but you're expected to fund yourself doing more work through the summer, no?
18:04 <@advil> so I'm not really even being paid for the summer (though I get my 9-month salary distributed through 12 months, also common)
18:04 <@advil> yeah, that is the culture
18:05 <@advil> I did take a real 10 day vacation in june, to Paris ;-)
18:07 <@zackoid> the first and last until you make tenure?
18:07 <@advil> there's not an expectation per se that I augment up to 12 months, but there is also the expectation that I don't sit around playing stardew valley all summer

19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[4/5]: Finally, stab damage gets an additional bonus multiplier of (12 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / {stab bonus}) / 12 for all weapons.
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[5
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[5/5]: (lower is better): sleeping/paralysed = 1, netted/webbed/petrifying/petrified = 2, invisible/confused/fleeing/ally = 4, distracted = 6
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[1
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[1/5]: A stab with a short blade does increased damage: (dam+bonus)*mult, where bonus depends on your dex as well as your stealth and weapon skills and is capped at 30, and mult depends on your stealth/weapon skills and the type of stab (sleep/paralysis is best). Non-short blades don't get a bonus and have lower mult. Daggers get bonus doubled (but still capped at 30).
19:26 <@zackoid> ??stabbing[3
19:26 < OCTOTROG> stabbing[3/5]: For short/long blades and one-handed polearms, stab damage gets a bonus multiplier of (10 + ((stealth skill + weapon skill) / 2) / ({stab bonus} + 2 (if using a long blade or one-handed polearm))) / 10

12:28 <@shmup> but i didnt check my race abilities
12:29 <@shmup> ???naga
12:29 < OCTOTROG> The player race has sInv, rPois, a poisonous spit attack, +5 stealth apt and natural stealth boosts, plus xl/3 natural AC. In return, they have a penalty to movement speed, receive halved base AC for body armours, and cannot wear boots (though bardings have 4 base AC). Nagas gain constriction at xl13. / Universally slow-moving (but normal attack speed); {Naga mage}s and {Greater Naga}
12:29 < OCTOTROG> use haste and conjurations to deal with this. All naga also have constriction. Basic {naga} are weak, while {Naga Warriors} are bulky and hit hard. A {Salamander} is essentially fire-themed Naga. Also see: {Naga Ritualist} {Salamander Firebrand} {Salamander Stormcaller} {Naga Sharpshooter}
12:38 <@zackoid> they can spit poison yeah
12:38 <@zackoid> and you really need to abuse it to survive
12:38 <@zackoid> they're strong eventually but one of the worst starting races because you can't run from anything

10:01 <@shmup> you can really really really start out unluckily as a caster
10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a rat on D:1, with 4 points after 46 turns and 0:01:06. [cbro+]
10:02 <@shmup> lol

10:02 < OCTOTROG> shmup the Firebug (L1 HOFE), slain by a giant gecko on D:1, with 2 points after 44 turns and 0:00:34. [cbro+]
10:02 <@zackoid> it's not so much unlucky as you're lucky when you're not killed by the first think you meet.
10:03 <@zackoid> giant gecko is probably the wost possible first monster now.
10:03 <@zackoid> rats or bats are the best.
10:04 <@shmup> yeah, fair. lucky wasn't even what i was feeling
10:05 <@shmup> well in rat scenario it was starting and i could situate myself so only 1 thing could get me.
10:05 <@shmup> but it was.. 5 rats? 1 kobold? then a final rat? or something.
10:05 <@zackoid> yah that's pretty bad.
10:05 < OCTOTROG> shmup (L1 HOFE) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
10:05 <@zackoid> if there's something you can do about that i don't know what it is.
10:06 <@shmup> my best chance so far was when i found a spear instantly. then an enchanted dagger i should not have equipped ;)
10:07 <@advil> for a caster start a first priority is to find somewhere where you can pillar dance
10:07 <@zackoid> now that monster-generated weapons are identified i never pick up anything blue off the ground until i have a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> i heard someone else say that recently but i don't get it
10:08 <@shmup> why not hold in inventory?
10:08 <@shmup> it's not like you're gonna hit max inv by time you get a couple rc
10:08 <@shmup> well, unlikely
10:09 <@zackoid> i think the early generation is biased toward cursed stuff but i don't know that
10:09 <@zackoid> and 95% of the time by the time i would want any of that i have a decent weapon anyway
10:45 < necKro> we could just add a .. that works like !!
10:45 < necKro> or something
10:46 <@zackoid> are there any . commands that are useful?
10:49 <@advil> I'm not sure what "." means conventionally as opposed to "!"
10:49 <@advil> but some of them could be useful I guess
10:50 <@advil> that is, they don't seem any less useful than the ! ones, just sometimes a bit more special purpose
10:50 <@advil> lots of ones that trigger specific tvs, or find specific kinds of killers, or deaths on particular maps
10:50 <@advil> like johnstein has .hsmap
10:50 <@advil> er
10:50 <@advil> .jsmap
10:51 <@advil> it's the = ones that aren't very useful on their own
11:34 <@shmup> scroll through the list, zackoid .

12:25 <@shmup> you think vehemut, zackoid?
12:27 <@zackoid> depends if you want to hit things with axes or blast
12:30 <@shmup> i only picked up the damn axe cause i thought i wanted a weapon
12:31 <@shmup> i wanna blast. but i did put 6 points in my axe
12:31 <@shmup> which obv it'd need more. shit
12:31 <@shmup> what would you go with if you wanted to axe but still blast a bit. some armour/weapon god? 
12:33 <@zackoid> i usually use ash for that case, but ash is kinda tough if you're not used to blasters 'cause xhe doesn't provide a lot of help early on.  i think vehumet is the easiest way to learn the conj playstyle.
12:33 <@zackoid> axes are just XP hungry relative to other weapons, though the apt might balance that out i'm not sure

10:24 <@zackoid> pfft not even a full-health 1-shot
10:24 <@zackoid> did you drag that up from d:3
10:24 <@zackoid> ?
10:27 <@shmup> yeah. i left it behind and then chose the wrong stairs later.
10:28 <@zackoid> one of the dumbest lessons that took me too long to learn was not to go (immediately) back down the same stairs you just narrowly escaped via
10:28 <@zackoid> also to use X-e
10:28 <@shmup> that's not what happened but that is a good lesson
10:29 <@shmup> i just happened to go back to the same stairs after doing other things
10:29 <@zackoid> yeah i know what you meant, what i'm talking about is much dumber
10:29 <@zackoid> but it is a good idea to drop exclusions for that reason
10:29 <@shmup> ahh. X-e though? sec
10:29 <@shmup> oh i should do that ^
10:30 <@shmup> i def 10000% wanna start doing that actually

10:30 <@shmup> yes..
10:30 <@shmup> damn.
10:44 <@advil> it's a very good idea, especially on a non noisy char
10:45 <@advil> I find that in lair I set 1-4 exclusions per level routinely
10:51 <@zackoid> and then you auto-travel to the edge of your exclusion and wake up a different monster that wakes up the one you excluded.

13:07 <@zackoid> ??energy randomization
13:07 < OCTOTROG> energy randomisation[1/3]: Every time a monster makes a movement (i.e. not an attack/spell), the amount of time taken to do its turn has a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns slower, a 1/3 chance of being 0.1 turns quicker and a 1/3 chance of being the normal amount. Over time, these 0.1s add up or cancel out to cause 'double moves' or 'lost moves'.
13:07 <@shmup> okay so i went for it on purpose tho cause i was a bit stealthy
13:07 <@shmup> and got up on it and got it to yellow but then

13:08 <@shmup> i was just commenting on speed
13:08 <@zackoid> i think you want to learn conj flame before sticky probs
13:08 <@zackoid> conj flame is really good and much easier to cast
13:09 <@zackoid> also totally forget about stabs
13:09 <@zackoid> try to kill everything at the edge of LoS
13:09 <@zackoid> stab power depends on having stealth and shortblade skill
13:09 <@zackoid> also if an ogre is asleep on D:3 let it sleep.
13:10 <@shmup> oh, all right
13:10 <@shmup> yeah i havent tried conj once yet
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[1/2]: A level 3 spell that creates a cloud of flame in the selected unoccupied space. Many weaker monsters will be unwilling to cross it, but some tougher or less intelligent ones will.
13:10 <@shmup> ??conjure flame[2
13:10 < OCTOTROG> conjure flame[2/2]: Usage: Fight in corridors. Lure things into corridors. Conjure flame in front of them.
13:10 <@zackoid> the unoccupied place is the most important thing to remember, you have to use it before the monster gets to you
13:10 <@zackoid> but it lets you seal off halways from weak things and blast at your leisure
13:10 <@zackoid> strong things and dumb things will walk right through it, but it does good damage especially if you can trap them in it or chain them
13:24 <@shmup> i don't wanna ever exist in a world where a high elf can't outrun an ogre btw

Always has a cloak. Random colour. Like an ogre, he can deal up to 35 or so damage in one shot. Or paralyse or banish you.

09:43 <@shmup> i'm still uncertain about conjure flame
09:43 <@shmup> i've only tried it a bit, but even an adder won't walk in the damn thing.
09:43 <@advil> uncertain?
09:43 <@shmup> like, not familiar with it
09:43 <@advil> ah
09:43 <@shmup> not sure how dumb is dumb re: mob brains
09:43 <@advil> it's very, very good
09:43 <@zackoid> adder not walking into it is good
09:43 <@shmup> fair
09:44 <@zackoid> only really dumb weak things will walk into it
09:44 <@shmup> so you use it to gain distance AND maybe deal damage if they're super dumb
09:44 <@zackoid> really dumb means mostly zombocoms and skeletons
09:44 <@advil> whether something with brains will walk into it depends on hp, so it's hard to predict
09:44 <@shmup> okay yeah no that does change my viewpoint re distance
09:44 <@zackoid> STRONG things will just not gaf
09:44 <@advil> insects too?
09:44 <@zackoid> though it depends on how much HP they have at the time

09:45 <@advil> maybe not any more
09:45 <@zackoid> ??monster intelligence
09:45 < OCTOTROG> monster intelligence[1/12]: From worst to best: Brainless, Animal, Human. This has many effects on monster behaviour, most notably pursuing you longer, pathfinding better, being more wary of traps/clouds and moving in ways that inconviences you more.
09:45 <@zackoid> there used to be more, right?
09:45 <@advil> yeah
09:46 <@advil> flame cloud is reliable for damaging heavy things, uniques, hydras, that sort of monster
09:46 <@advil> otherwise you use it to trap something while you shoot it or poke at it with a polearm
09:48 <@advil> oh the other thing is that if something's already in a cloud, it will freely walk to more clouds
09:48 <@advil> situationally useful to know
09:49 <@shmup> trying to figure out X-e more.
09:49 <@shmup> by default it fills all rooms visible red, autotravel excluded? but i can press again to just mark single ones (white) and.. those are excluded.. but surrounding is all red still?
09:49 <@zackoid> the 'in another cloud' part is more important with freezing cloud since you can drop that on top of monsters
09:50 <@shmup> i just wanna say "this stair is excluded"
09:50 <@shmup> "stop me if i'm gonna try going up it"
09:50 <@shmup> "or tell me rather"
09:50 <@zackoid> once is LOS from the spot, twice is the spot itself, thrice is clear
09:50 <@shmup> okay well that's what i don't like ^
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a regular spot it changes color
09:50 <@shmup> if it's a stair it does not
09:50 <@shmup> re: spot itself/twice
09:50 <@zackoid> #consoleproblems
09:50 <@shmup> lol
09:51 <@advil> I think technically when you set it on a stair the exclusion is on the other floor
09:51 <@advil> so it'll show there
09:51 <@zackoid> on tiles it works normally
09:51 <@shmup> ty it worked. 
09:51 <@shmup> i mean it yelled at me when trying to go up

09:53 <@zackoid> johnstein: this is wrong, right?
09:53 <@zackoid> https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=21032
09:54 <@zackoid> i've used wizmode on dbro but i thought that was disabled for most people.
09:56 < johnstein> both cbro and dbro compile for wizmode
09:56 < johnstein> on cbro there's dgamelaunch Magic to check if you are a glad
09:56 < johnstein> uh
09:56 < johnstein> if you are a dgladmin
09:57 < johnstein> ie on the admin list. only devs and the occasional other server admin's are on the list and it's a manual process
09:57 < johnstein> so gammafunk can play wizmode on cbro
09:57 < johnstein> and everyone can play wizmode on dbro
09:58 < johnstein> and I'm not sure about the load concern. but I remember someone (some dev?) said there are mild security concerns
09:58 < johnstein> but no one elaborated when I asked for specifics. probably with mildly good reason
09:58 < johnstein> ie not discussing them openly in a chat room with a public searchable log
09:59 < johnstein> I should reply in that thread.  but ugh, Tavern
10:01 <@zackoid> i just thought it odd that a non-admin would talk about using wizmode on CBRO
10:01 < johnstein> oh did I read it wrong?
10:01 < johnstein> he says 8081
10:01 < johnstein> that's dbro
10:01 <@zackoid> ah.
10:01 <@zackoid> i always used dev.
10:02 < johnstein> my snarky reply is, "I can't Believe any lamers aren't using the dev.berotato.org address for dbro"
10:02 <@zackoid> they better not blow up my secret wizmode spot.

13:34 <@zackoid> ah the old double shaft
13:44 <@zackoid> i wonder how hard it would be to have a bot command that fetched the skills, stats, slot a and slot b items from a current dump, launch a crawl instance, fsim weapon a and b, and dump the results back.  everything except returning the results could be done with command line scripting and internal lua i think, though it'd be pretty hacky
13:45 <@zackoid> how hacky depending on if lua can read from arbitrary files.
13:47 <@zackoid> probably the whole thing could be done with pexpect
14:29 <@shmup> what is fsim, zackoid?

14:31 <@zackoid> wizmode fight simulator.  
14:31 <@zackoid> i most use it to compare weapons
14:31 <@zackoid> mostly
14:39 <@zackoid> why is this in the crawl FAQ under 'easy gods for new players': "The most straightforward gods to play are probably Trog or Okawaru (for melee and ranged combat), Vehumet or Sif Muna (for spellcasting), and Yredelemnul (for undead allies). Also, while unreliable, Xom can be a lot of fun."
14:39 <@zackoid> that is an awful answer.
14:40 <@shmup> haha
14:40 <@shmup> indeed
14:45 <@zackoid> even ignoring the xom part, sif is one of the worst gods for a new player and yred, while strong, involves ally management, one of the most frustrating things in crawl.
14:55 <@shmup> what two spelling casting gods would you recommend
14:56 <@zackoid> for a beginner i would not recommend casting at all, and framing it as casting god vs not is problematic anyway.  but if someone was trying to learn how to play a primary-conjurations character i would say vehumet, because vehumet is very straightforward.

14:16 <@shmup> shit zackoid okay so I discovered a thing..
14:16 <@shmup> pr much in this highlighted area: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/fight.cc#L756-L787
14:17 <@shmup> i had to do 5 of those checks for various things, ignoring branding (obv)
14:17 <@shmup> but i wasnt doing the 772-774 shit. it did change my numbers for at least crossbows. need to check others. but.. curious if you can help verify that they're actually right now.
14:19 <@zackoid> i thiiiink short blades and crossbows are the only exceptions to .7 rule
14:19 <@zackoid> outside of unrands
14:20 <@shmup> well if you could peek again whenever
14:20 <@shmup> are you on git or 18
14:20 <@shmup> .18
14:20 <@zackoid> git.
14:20 <@shmup> http://dev.host/~shmup/crawl/dcss-weapons.txt
14:20 <@zackoid> next tournament will be around novemberish probably
14:21 <@zackoid> crossbow skill reqs are still wrong on that
14:21 <@zackoid> ??club
14:21 < OCTOTROG> club[1/2]: (maces & flails; +3 acc / 5 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay). A heavy piece of wood. Bad.
14:21 <@zackoid> weird.
14:21 <@shmup> man i need to reserve iceland room ASAP i am being a shithead
14:21 <@shmup> you reminded me cause maybe i will be in iceland during the tournament
14:22 <@shmup> hmmmmmmmmm
14:22 <@shmup> @ what you just said
14:22 < odiv> Octopodes are OP
14:22 <@zackoid> odiv: you typed o instead of u
14:22 <@shmup> he was making a joke yo
14:23 <@zackoid> about uctopodes?
14:23 <@shmup> lol
14:23 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc won Op-- s=name,class
14:23 < OCTOTROG> 12 games for @mfc (won Op--): 2x murphyslaw (Artificer, Transmuter), 2x TheNoid (Berserker, Venom Mage), Kramin (Berserker), isthmus (Berserker), kaibutsu (Berserker), valrus (Skald), odiv (Wizard), advil (Ice Elementalist), zackoid (Ice Elementalist), slitherrr (Venom Mage)
14:23 <@zackoid> i'm not using a shield which feels like suicide but i have this amazing arbalest
14:24 < odiv> So at least you'll die feeling like a badass.
14:24 <@zackoid> but i can't afford to train it up so it shoots at 1.5 delay
14:24 <@zackoid> so i feel like i'm making a horrible stategic mistake
14:26 <@shmup> so you're specifically saying my skill required and min delay is wrong
14:26 <@shmup> not the first 3 numbers that require no modification (come straight from source as defined)
14:27 <@shmup> dmg/hit/base-delay that is
14:27 <@zackoid> those look fine yeah
14:27 <@shmup> OK. well. man. how do you know they're wrong btw
14:27 <@shmup> i believe you of course lol
14:28 <@zackoid> it says in game.
14:28 <@shmup> ohh, okay
14:28 <@zackoid> also triple xbows requiring 32 skill was a little suspicious
14:28 <@shmup> yeah heh well i did address that but
14:28 <@zackoid> if you fix the mindelay (it's 1.0) the skill will fix itself
14:28 <@shmup> can you tell me what one of them are btw?
14:28 <@shmup> either for hand or triple
14:28 <@shmup> or whatever i guess heh
14:29 <@zackoid> skill is 10/18 for sure...26 i think for triple
14:29 <@shmup> ok ty
14:34 <@zackoid> i have 8 ring slots and only MR+.
14:37 <@shmup> lol
14:39 <@helicomatic> more games need octopus style imo
14:39 <@helicomatic> that actually made me real mad in diablo when I was a kid, you have 10 fingers but 2 rings
14:41 <@shmup> i wanna see the wiki list of games that let's you wear a ring on every finger

14:59 <@helicomatic> live by the crossbow, die by the crossbow
15:00 <@zackoid> The vault warden hits you from afar with a vampiric glaive!!!
15:00 <@zackoid> was the bigger issue.
15:00 <@helicomatic> ah
15:00 <@helicomatic> those are long
15:03 <@shmup> dang
15:06 <@zackoid> i think that situation might have been literally unsurvivable once the convoker fired.  maybe an immediate double blink before even taking damage, but even that would have been iffy.

12:45 <@zackoid> are you ughing both?
12:45 < odiv> I need to get back into this.
12:45 < odiv> instead of just at tournament time
12:46 <@shmup> no you don't
12:46 <@shmup> do you feel like playing right now
13:26 < advil> the TrHu is at least novel, but DgAr is one of those rolls that makes you not want to play by hyper rules
13:28 <@zackoid> do the rules exclude 'accidently' taking one step too many with an adder in LoS?

14:13 <@zackoid> https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/a75ee9761a89626fe171cf83823357b1ab0daba3
14:13 <@zackoid> that one is pretty big.
14:13 < advil> that pakellas wrath went on forever?
14:13 <@zackoid> yeah.
14:13 <@zackoid> so you never had MP regen again
14:16 < advil> that stair change is interesting
14:17 < advil> I'm pretty sure I have chars that would have been alive if that change were in place
14:18 <@zackoid> white very ugly thing vs tengu?
14:19 <@zackoid> i don't intuitively grasp the difference in the speed, but i guess it might mean that a very faster monster might attack you at the top of the stairs before you can act again now?
14:19 < advil> why yes, I'm glad you remember my painful deaths too :-P
14:19 < advil> yeah seems that way...maybe a slight nerf to ac chars
14:20 <@zackoid> it helps to distribute all the built up salt i have from my last game
14:21 < advil> haha
14:21 < advil> is that the optm I saw in the backlog?
14:22 <@zackoid> yeah, though it was more a combination of losing 6 previously to that, all to fast monsters i had no way of dealing with at xl10.  so i finally broke through that wall and had two runes and then died in two turns.
14:23 <@zackoid> MR+ and 6AC is not a solid combination in vaults.  without stoneskin existing you're really dependent on finding statue form i think.
14:26 <@zackoid> the real, deep-down problem is that for some dumb reason i really like form changers but the best form changer races are extremely frail (fe, op, dr is ok).  and there's no guarantee you'll actually get the useful forms.
14:34 < advil> I've never really gotten in to form changers for some reason
14:35 < advil> my one really strong one had such good unarmed it was unnecessary to actually change forms
14:35 <@zackoid> anything that can wear body armour is probably better off just using BH.  and only then if they don't have claws.
14:36 < advil> even blade hands didn't really seem worth it on that char
14:38 <@zackoid> was it a naga of chei?
14:38 < advil> yep

14:39 <@zackoid> chei worshippers hit hard enough that they already do a lot of overkill
14:40 <@zackoid> my naga of chei used blade hands 191 times.  whereas a mftm of ash used it 757 times.
14:44 < advil> I used it all of 64 times
14:47 < advil> it doesn't help that I kind of like the aesthetic of punching orbs of fire to death

16:53 < odiv> that's a good q
17:08 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil the Charlatan (L2 DgAr), slain by a goblin (a +0 club) (led by Robin) on D:2, with 31 points after 1415 turns and 0:06:26. [cbro+]
17:09 < advil> robin with a wand of slowing is tougher than regular robin
17:09 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L1 DsWn) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
17:10 <@zackoid> hyperezmode
17:10 <@zackoid> advil: i recommend uskayaw.
17:10 < advil> it's a pretty lame wn start
17:10 < advil> a +2 short sword and 2 curing potions
17:10 <@zackoid> mine was 4.0 summoning skill with 2 necro spells.
17:10 < advil> I think all my other wanderer successes have had books
17:11 <@zackoid> 2 curing is pretty dang powerful though
17:12 < advil> hm I have 2 hexes
17:14 <@zackoid> which reminds me
17:14 <@zackoid> !!oneandwon
17:14 < OCTOTROG> Chars won first try for zackoid: KoAK, HOVM, HuIE, HOMo, TeAE, MiAr, OgFi, DrWz, DsBe, CeNe, GhFi, DsWn, FoAK, HEIE
17:16 < advil> did 0 skill throwing get slightly better again?
17:16 < advil> rocks are doing more damage than I expect
17:30 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) killed the ghost of Stef the Magician, an amateur DEIE of Nemelex Xobeh. (D:4) [cbro+]
17:31 < advil> for once, guardian comes through
17:33 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) killed Natasha. (D:3) [cbro+]
17:34 < advil> ??uskayaw
17:34 < OCTOTROG> uskayaw[1/5]: God of ecstatic dance. Piety raises very quickly as you deal damage and drops very quickly over time. *: Stomp for AOE damage. **: Teleport through a line of creatures, confusing them. ***: on reaching this piety level, briefly paralyze all enemies in LOS. ****: On reaching this piety level, monsters share damage. *****: Telefrag any monster in LOS.
17:35 <@zackoid> advil: i think it's only the DPS that changed
17:35 <@zackoid> i'm really interested in trying uskayaw in a zig
17:35 <@zackoid> but i'm not interested in getting there, because i hate extended.
17:35 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L5 DsWn) became a worshipper of Uskayaw. (D:3) [cbro+]
17:36 < advil> I doubt this one will make it that far
17:36 < advil> having fairly bad luck
17:36 <@zackoid> i only suggested it because i just did a dswn of uskayaw as my last win
17:36 < advil> well, I haven't tried uskayaw
17:37 < advil> and it's the 3rd altar I've found
17:37 <@zackoid> but ds is way hardiers than any of the other species i tried with usk.  i picked it mostly because i wanted to see how it'd be with something stronk, but i didn't want to do mi
17:37 < advil> usk is invocations?
17:37 < advil> seems like I can train it now
17:37 < advil> ???uskayaw
17:37 < OCTOTROG> God of ecstatic dance. Piety raises very quickly as you deal damage and drops very quickly over time. *: Stomp for AOE damage. **: Teleport through a line of creatures, confusing them. ***: on reaching this piety level, briefly paralyze all enemies in LOS. ****: On reaching this piety level, monsters share damage. *****: Telefrag any monster in LOS. / *: Stomp. **: Line Pass. *****:
17:37 < OCTOTROG> Grand Finale. Upon reaching ***, briefly and irresistably paralyze all monsters in LOS. Upon reaching ****, pain bond all monsters in LOS. The *** and **** powers can be triggered once per 30 turns. All powers scale heavily w/ Invo. / reasons <namelastname112> The balrug is hit by a flying piece of Cerebov! /

17:37 <@zackoid> yeah
17:38 < advil> what invoc do I want?
17:38 <@zackoid> it scales up pretty heavily at first, but i'm not sure where the dimishing returns are
17:38 <@zackoid> the more the better, especially with Ds apt
17:38 < advil> yeah, I always forget about that aptitude
17:38 < advil> how does usk interact with allies?
17:38 < advil> should have asked that first
17:39 < advil> I have guardian
17:39 <@zackoid> http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue//zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20160809-024758.txt
17:39 <@zackoid> i actually ended up all the way at 26, but the 15 is more indicative probably
17:39 <@zackoid> interact how?
17:40 <@zackoid> i don't know if their damage contributes to piety
17:40 < advil> do they block these moving around abilities?
17:40 <@zackoid> i don't recall
17:40 <@zackoid> i think you can add them to the confuse chain and i don't think he cares
17:41 <@zackoid> but i only had undead allies in that game
17:41 < advil> is any weapon school better than others with usk?
17:42 <@zackoid> i did long blades because he gives two types of stab opportunities, so i trained short blades early and long blades when i found them.  eventually i rarely switched, but in the midgame it can be helpful to get the stabs
17:42 <@zackoid> axes help build piety faster
17:42 <@zackoid> faith is REALLY good
17:42 <@zackoid> the early-mid game is all about getting above the damage curve, but once you are it's really fun
17:43 < advil> I was aiming for long blades since I still don't have a new longblade win, but I haven't exactly found one
17:44 < advil> though there's a randart long sword in a shop
17:44 <@zackoid> any book (or wn) start you are usually using shortblades for a long time anyway

17:45 <@zackoid> heh, 17 feels like ancient history with how many of those spells have been removed
17:47 <@zackoid> what do you think is actually a required zig kit?
17:49 < advil> I'm not sure I have a general answer
17:49 < advil> I went in the first time with only some of that stuff and it wasn't enough, for a DE caster
17:50 < advil> iirc  I didn't have firestorm or necromutation the first time
17:50 <@zackoid> well a level 9 spell and channeling and either MP or HP on kills seems to be popular
17:50 < advil> I got a really bad mummy floor and only survived via fog
17:50 < advil> oh yeah I didn't have the cboe online the first time either
17:50 < advil> just vehumet isn't really enough

17:54 < advil> for boolean disjunction use (( p || q ))
17:54 <@zackoid> it's so hard to read zig logs because everything is clumped in 27

17:58 <@zackoid> both on mummy levels
18:00 <@zackoid> that's the problem with zigs
18:00 <@zackoid> though i guess in this case it's megazigs.  but still gozag->TSO just to grind to the point where you can start.
18:01 < advil> zombies show damage now?
18:02 <@zackoid> yeah.
18:02 <@zackoid> and also heal maybe?
18:03 < advil> the +8 long sword of Undoing {slice, MR- Str+4 Int+4}
18:03 < advil> pity about that MR
18:04 <@zackoid> that's pretty good until after lair

18:05 < OCTOTROG> vehumet wrath[1/3]: ABANDONMENT: 25 penance. RETRIBUTION: HD = your XL. Spell level = 1 + random_range(XL/5,XL/3) capped at 9. Spells include fire storm/hellfire at 9, LCS at 8, poison arrow/iron shot at 6. XL27? Expect 3d20 hellfire, 8d20 fire storm and 3d48 LCS. All of which ignore your EV/SH.
18:05 <@zackoid> that doesn't sound very friendly.
18:06 < advil> he is the god of magical destruction after all
18:06 < advil> when do I use usk stuff?
18:06 < advil> whenever I can?
18:06 <@zackoid> yeah, you'll go from full piety to 1 star in 5 steps if you're not fighting
18:07 < advil> phew, not monstrous
18:07 <@zackoid> depends on the situation.  early on i usually line pass as soon as i hit **
18:07 <@zackoid> because i need everythig i can get
18:07 <@zackoid> later you can let it go to pain bond or the nuke when needed
18:08 <@zackoid> the biggest problem i had in all my games was building piety when my only damage source was a dagger or short sword of venom
18:08 <@zackoid> so the long sword should smooth that out a lot
18:08 < advil> heh
18:08 < advil> what about stomp?
18:08 <@zackoid> they nerfed poison damage piety gain hard because people were abusing it
18:08 <@zackoid> i only use stomp to finish off weak things mostly
18:09 <@zackoid> rarely it'll do enough damage to make up for the piety cost but not often and i'm guessing never at low invoke
18:10 <@zackoid> *** and **** are crazy strong at higher invoke
18:12 <@zackoid> i think i saw that demonic guardian got buffed recently
18:12 < advil> oh really?
18:12 < advil> it seems very good, but I haven't had it in like 4 years
18:12 < advil> so I'm probably a lot better at using it than I would have been
18:13 <@zackoid> i think it was just like shadow imps instead of crimson
18:13 <@zackoid> but six furies are now 3's also, i don't know if that matters

18:15 <@zackoid> you are playng this all wrong
18:15 <@zackoid> uskayaw is the god of bad decisions
18:16 <@zackoid> you're supposed to run up to mobs and punch them in the nose and then go over and punch their friends in the nose too
18:16 <@zackoid> maybe not d:7 ugly things tho
18:16 < advil> heh
18:16 < advil> now I'm standing next to an ugly thing at xl 8, does that count?
18:17 <@zackoid>  that's better.
18:17 < advil> haha yeah that was all fairly unwise
18:18 <@zackoid> not if you're generating piety quickly
18:18 <@zackoid> fyi the paralyzation is something like max 4 turns
18:18 <@zackoid> at higher invoke
18:18 < advil> well I don't think the line pass was a good move, I should have figured there were other red monsters over there
18:19 <@zackoid> the theme song to this run is shut up and dance

22:47 < advil> does uskayaw work well enough at vaults 5 to rely on his powers?
22:57 <@zackoid> i was waiting for a teleport at that point.  i left the stairs via line pass to get the warden because the rhythm got me, knowing it was a terrible idea
22:58 <@zackoid> i wrecked the welcoming commitee but, at least with my defenses, you can't put out enough damage to take out THAT mass safely

11:51 <@zackoid> whoa: https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/e213fbe9c8345be16549d0715d7deb1c3d1282dc
11:52 <@zackoid> not that it wasn't obvious immediately that this would happen.
12:02 < odiv> !!polytheist odiv
12:02 < OCTOTROG> Unwon gods for odiv: Elyvilon, Fedhas, Gozag, Hepliaklqana, Qazlal, Sif Muna, Ukayaw, Uskayaw, Xom, Yredelemnul, Zin
12:02 < odiv> Well, I got my pak win.
12:02 < advil> pak probably doesn't count for polytheist right now
12:04 < odiv> oh, that's true
12:04 < odiv> I think I did get a pak win though.
12:05 < odiv> !hs odiv god=pakellas
12:05 < OCTOTROG> 2. odiv the Grand Gadgeteer (L27 GhAr of Pakellas), escaped with the Orb and 5 runes on 2016-05-20 03:16:40, with 2522096 points after 102883 turns and 9:47:21.
12:05 < odiv> is that how you do it?
12:05 < odiv> oh man, I forgot I had that win
12:05 < odiv> !greatplayer
12:05 < OCTOTROG> Unwon species for odiv: Felid, Formicid, Mummy, Ogre, Spriggan, Tengu
12:06 < odiv> those last three souldn't be too hard.
12:06 < advil> only 2 really hard ones left!
12:06 < odiv> formicid gives me the willies, but you're probably right.
12:07 < advil> just imagine using a bardiche with a large shield
12:07 < odiv> mmm
12:07 < odiv> can they still use 2h launchers and shields?
12:07 < advil> !hs . fo -log
12:07 < OCTOTROG> 16. advil, XL27 FoAK, T:125132: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue/advil/morgue-advil-20150615-215520.txt
12:07 < advil> yeah, I was using arbalests too
12:17 < odiv> sweet
12:19 <@zackoid> Fo is probably the easiest on that list
12:20 <@zackoid> at least in terms of win%
12:20 < odiv> I might try that next
12:20 < odiv> !greaterplayer
12:20 < OCTOTROG> Unwon backgrounds for odiv: Arcane Marksman, Skald, Summoner, Venom Mage, Warper
12:20 < odiv> FoAM?
12:20 < odiv> or Sk maybe?
12:20 <@zackoid> --AK is the traditional combo.  all those backgrounds are pretty bad.
12:21 <@zackoid> AM and VM are 'recommended' for Fo
12:22 <@zackoid> wait finesse works on formicids now?
12:25 <@zackoid> !!lg @mgf Fo-- won s=class
12:26 < OCTOTROG> No games for @mgf (Fo-- won).
12:26 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc Fo-- won s=class
12:26 < OCTOTROG> 10 games for @mfc (Fo-- won): 4x Abyssal Knight, 3x Fighter, 2x Artificer, Healer
12:27 < advil> I think Sp is the easiest thing on that list
12:28 <@zackoid> i do not query this as proof against that assertion:

12:31 <@zackoid> heh, things i learn from that chart: centaurs are mostly played by thenoid.  octopodes are unreasonably popular.  nobody likes halflings or ghouls.
12:32 < advil> probably that chart is skewed by challenges as much as anything
12:32 < odiv> I like halflings :)
12:32 <@zackoid> !!lg @mfc Ha-- s=name
12:32 < OCTOTROG> 539 games for @mfc (Ha--): 53x kagredon, 51x valrus, 48x ZombieSheep, 36x zackoid, 35x porpoise, 35x odiv, 34x tkappleton, 27x murphyslaw, 25x keeo, 21x sleevener, 21x omnomnOMINOUS, 19x demiurge, 19x Kramin, 18x isthmus, 12x 256, 11x apoch, 8x zeidrich, 8x advil, 6x Hildebrand, 5x TheNoid, 4x laceratedsky, 4x necKro23, 4x ces, 4x slitherrr, 4x Gami, 4x Greynaab, 3x RogerD, 3x

12:33 <@zackoid> ghoul was even a challenge!  except i won that one which is pretty good evidence that nobody participated in it.
12:33 <@zackoid> re: spriggan vs formicid, spriggan are probably 'stronger' but they have that whoops-you're-dead aspect that i think makes it hard to recommend them as such
12:34 < advil> !lg goodplayers fo|sp s=crace / won
12:34 < OCTOTROG> 2187/90641 games for goodplayers (fo || sp): 1300/56777x Spriggan [2.29%], 887/33864x Formicid [2.62%]
12:35 <@zackoid> i would guess relative god choice explains not only that difference but flips it

12:36 < advil> interesting
12:37 < advil> not that that restriction is necessarily still meaningful, it's just looking at accounts that now meet those constraints

12:39 <@zackoid> i was not expecting AK to lead by that much for spriggan.
12:39 <@zackoid> is that people doing abyss dive stunts?
12:39 < advil> AK is popular for Sp

13:28 <@zackoid> also did you guys see that crawl has finally entered it's final, purest form?
13:28 <@zackoid> https://github.com/Dracunos/gnollcrawl
13:38 < odiv> AK gives good escape options and also corruption is (was?) pretty sweet for disrupting branch ends and sneaking out with the rune.
13:38 < odiv> only gnolls?
13:38 <@zackoid> plus AK has an MR-checking instakill.
13:38 < odiv> oooh, right, yeah
13:38 <@zackoid> odiv: dungeon crawl: gnoll soup.
13:39 <@zackoid> http://imgur.com/hH1ddlv
13:40 < odiv> battleaxe should be called gnollslayer.
13:40 <@zackoid> looks like he added fake_lang gnoll to replace butt
14:10 < advil> did corruption change?  it should still be good
14:11 <@zackoid> not that i know of.
14:12 < advil> corrupting vaults 5 is fun
14:12 < advil> also, being able to freely wield distortion weapons (and make one) is great
14:31 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L10 DsWn) entered the Lair of Beasts. (D:8) [cbro+]
14:35 < advil> heh a green rat pack gets me enough piety to telefrag apparently
14:39 < advil> line pass is pretty good
14:39 <@shmup> !gamesby hyperadvil
14:40 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil has played 15 games, between 2014-09-18 18:00:22 and 2016-08-16 21:08:46, won 1 (6.7%), high score 1421695, total score 1542364, total turns 200781, play-time/day 0:01:30, total time 17:34:45.
14:43 <@zackoid> it's the best active ability of the 3 for sure
14:43 <@zackoid> telefrag i found to be rarely useful
14:43 < advil> seems like it's good for style points in extended
14:43 <@zackoid> it costs all your piety, moves you out of position and rarely are you fighting something dangerous enough to warrant it and enough popcorn to build all that piety at the same time
14:45 <@zackoid> it's great when it works though
14:45 < OCTOTROG> hyperadvil (L10 DsWn) entered a volcano. (Lair:2) [cbro+]
14:48 < advil> riposte is noticeably better with a high + weapon than the last time I tried it
14:51 < advil> I wonder if I get piety from riposting?
14:51 <@zackoid> no idea, but i think the default assumption is that you would
14:56 < advil> no idea what ranged to go for on this char
14:56 < advil> I guess given my starting int of 22 it should be spells
14:57 < advil> not convinced that's a great idea though
15:10 <@zackoid> who needs ranged when you have zoom zoom
15:12 < advil> it's not a priority
15:12 < advil> but I do usually train at least throwing or evoc on combat characters these days
15:12 <@zackoid> i imagine you won't have 22 int by the time you care about it.
15:13 <@zackoid> yeah i had an iron rod, but i barely used it
15:13 < advil> er, where will my int go?
15:13 <@zackoid> line pass does let you get to things in the back fairly reliably
15:13 < advil> I also have a +7 int armour
15:13 <@zackoid> isn't 7 of it from a crappy leather armour?
15:13 < advil> no, it's 22 without that
15:13 <@zackoid> oh, you're not wearing that.
15:13 < advil> 29 with that
15:14 < advil> it's Wn random stats
15:14 <@zackoid> right, just misread
15:15 <@zackoid> seemed like a normal amount with the +7 included, but there's also 14 other +stat items
15:16 <@zackoid> i often feel like there's never enough XP for everything i want to skill, but then i see things like http://pastebin.com/AgYA69gy
15:16 <@zackoid> 24 in 3 defensive skills, puls 18 xbows, plus 16 weapon, plus 18 evoke
15:17 <@zackoid> and then 19 earth magic, with only sandblast memorized.
15:19 < advil> the earth magic is a nice touch
15:20 < advil> oh I guess I do have some +s on ring/sword

18:12 < odiv> hm
18:12 < odiv> what to acquire
18:12 < odiv> the age old quesiton
18:18 <@zackoid> ??rod acquirement
18:18 < OCTOTROG> staff acquirement[2/2]: If your Evocations is greater than (1d(sum of casting skills) - 4), you get a random rod with an 80% chance. Otherwise, you have a 50% chance to get the enhancer for your best skill if you haven't seen it (if you have, you have a flat 1/3 chance for any staff). Otherwise, you get wizardry, energy, or power, with the first two being twice as likely.
18:18 <@zackoid> i thought they moved rods out of staves
18:18 < odiv> I'll probably just go armour
18:19 <@zackoid> i think the 'right' answer is always wands unless you have haste+hw+tele, boringly
18:19 <@zackoid> ??misc acquirement
18:19 < OCTOTROG> 1/1. https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/acquire.cc#L664
18:19 <@zackoid> with trog i think book acquirement is a guaranteed manual
18:20 <@zackoid> guess i was wrong about rods
18:24 <@zackoid> nope, i was right.
18:24 < odiv> The water nymph is enraged by your magic-hating god!
18:24 < odiv> ha
18:24 <@zackoid>         if (class_wanted == OBJ_MISCELLANY && you.species != SP_FELID)

18:26 <@zackoid> ...ew.
18:27 < odiv> ratskin cloak
18:27 < odiv> :/
18:27 < odiv> I already have an rpois ring
18:27 <@zackoid> that's pretty good for an acquirement
18:27 < odiv> with rC+
18:27 <@zackoid> unless you have a really good cloak
18:27 < odiv> yeah, no it's still worht using
18:27 <@zackoid> not having to swap for rpois is nice.
18:28 < odiv> I lose almost 10% of my AC!
18:28 < odiv> heh

19:12 <@zackoid> i think i quit that one because i was salty that i never found portal projectile and now i have to get a 3rd rune without it
19:14 <@zackoid> huh:  D - the ring "Agalen" {Wiz *Confuse +Inv Str+8}

21:59 < odiv> zackoid: Not very until it kills you? :P
22:00 < odiv> I guess it depends how much confusion would screw you over.
22:00 < odiv> I generally just avoid all those brands
22:00 < odiv> which either means I'm too risk adverse or it's bad design
22:02 <@zackoid> contam isn't bad at all if you have EV
22:03 < odiv> ?
22:03 < odiv> contam/drain is on unequip, isn't it?
22:03 < odiv> or did that change? I haven't been around in a while.

14:44 < odiv> +8AC
14:44 < odiv> and +5 with a ring.

17:48 < advil> that one can go poorly
17:52 < odiv> Yeah, I'm pretty squishy
17:52 < odiv> I shouldn't even be in elf really.
17:53 < odiv> but ever since vaults requires a rune it's tough
17:57 < odiv> so...
17:57 < odiv> hm
17:57 < odiv> what to do
17:57 < odiv> hurl damnation sounds painful, frankly.
17:57 < advil> I had it on a Ds recently and barely used it
17:58 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L18 DsEE) was cast into the Abyss! (a deep elf demonologist) (WizLab) [cbro]

18:01 < odiv> ooh
18:02 < odiv> I did it!
18:02 < odiv> whee
18:04 < odiv> should I use that staff?
18:04 < odiv> It sounds like it hurts.
18:05 < zackoid> i'm not sure what the point of that item is
18:06 < zackoid> if you rely on conjurations it does way too much damage
18:07 < odiv> and you can't swap it, yeah
18:07 < zackoid> it'd be great on VpEn maybe?
18:08 < odiv> eh
18:08 < zackoid> actually now i really want it on a vpen
18:08 < odiv> I guess yeah
18:08 < odiv> but no healing
18:08 < zackoid> no healing?
18:08 < odiv> when you're bloodless
18:09 < zackoid> vamp heals when you're bloodless iirc
18:09 < odiv> oh sure, I was thinking you'd switch away for melee
18:09 < zackoid> but you don't need to be bloodless anyway
18:14 < odiv>  You drop the +3 pair of gloves of Makhleb's Displeasure {-Tele rPois Dex+4
18:14 < odiv> _Stlth+}.
18:14 < odiv> more like odiv's displeasure

22:58 < odiv> probably switch out of this armour at some point to robes.
22:58 < odiv> So I can shatter all the things.
23:04 < zackoid> you have 3 unidentified scrolls
23:04 < zackoid> !
23:04 < odiv> Yeah?
23:04 < odiv> summoning, torment, holy?
23:04 < odiv> or um, I forget hte other one
23:05 < odiv> silence
23:05 < zackoid> just use the ID scrolls on them
23:05 < odiv> nah
23:05 < zackoid> at least for summoning
23:05 < odiv> I have that one inscribed
23:05 < odiv> at least I think it's that.
23:05 < odiv> Maybe it's torment. :P
23:06 < zackoid> those defenses are...something.  especially considering a weapon of protection and a +5AC ring.  but such is the odiv of vehumet way.
23:06 < odiv> What do you mean somthing?
23:06 < odiv> like bad?
23:06 < odiv> also, weapon's not equipped rn
23:06 < zackoid> oh not wielding the trident, nm
23:06 < zackoid> yeah.
23:06 < zackoid> and yeah, bad.
23:06 < odiv> eh, they seem fine?
23:06 < zackoid> 8 dodging skill at xl21???
23:06 < odiv> +8 AC from scales
23:07 < odiv> You know what the best defense is?
23:07 < odiv> :D
23:07 < zackoid> yeah AC isn't terrible thanks to rings and mutations
23:07 < zackoid> but 15 dodging would be practically free at this point.  and 160HP is not good for a Ds
23:08 < zackoid> is there some nasty unique in spider?
23:08 < odiv> Ghost moths
23:08 < odiv> I have no SINv
23:08 < odiv> I should check again.
23:08 < odiv> but I don't think I've found any
23:08 < zackoid> stucky flame?
23:08 < odiv> Seems like I have barely any jewellery actually
23:08 < odiv> Yeah, I have that
23:09 < odiv> but that only works when they're right up on me
23:09 < odiv> and they drain MP from a distance
23:09 < zackoid> 5 pots of invis
23:09 < odiv> yeah, true
23:09 < odiv> It's been a while since I've been there.
23:09 < odiv> and I just finished vaults to 4
23:09 < odiv> So it's depths and Spider
23:10 < zackoid> no MR items at all?
23:11 < odiv> not that I could see
23:11 < odiv> I searched for magic and MR
23:11 < odiv> this robe I'm carrying could be

00:07 < odiv> reluctantly. :P
00:07 < odiv> even though I'm farther away from shatter.
00:08 < odiv> Did find a wizardry ring.
00:11 < odiv> still kinda lacking in gear
00:21 < zackoid> i've never cast shatter.
00:21 < zackoid> level 9 spells are not very useful in a <6 rune game, though i have cast all the rest i think
00:22 < odiv> Orrrr, you speed to the 9 spell and wreck zot with it. :P
00:52 < zackoid> does shatter work vs OOFs?
00:53 < odiv> they're flying, so not very well
00:53 < odiv> iron shot
00:53 < odiv> It takes down draconian packs realy well
00:53 < odiv> and liches, etc
00:53 < odiv> Just walk into a room, shatter 2-3 times.
00:53 < odiv> drop mic

13:49 < OCTOTROG> ds mutation rules[1/5]: Assuming you aren't monstrous, you get five facets, each consisting of three mutations (which usually just stack together). You will get one scales-type facet, one body-slot facet, two tier 2 facets, and one tier 3 facet. 
13:49 < odiv> ???ds mutation rules
13:49 < OCTOTROG> Assuming you aren't monstrous, you get five facets, each consisting of three mutations (which usually just stack together). You will get one scales-type facet, one body-slot facet, two tier 2 facets, and one tier 3 facet.  / The {scales}-type facets are icy blue, iridescent, molten, rough black, rugged brown, slimy green, thin metallic, or yellow scales, or alternatively thin skeletal
13:49 < OCTOTROG> structure, large bone plates, or a repulsion field. Body-slot facets: claws, horns, antennae, hooves, talons. / Tier 2 facets: powered by death, powered by pain, demonic guardian, nightstalker, spiny, rot (rRot, foul stench), fire (flame cloud immunity, rF+, ignite blood), ice (freezing cloud immunity, rC+, icemail), magic shield. / Tier 3 facets: robust (+30% HP), negative energy
13:49 < OCTOTROG> (rN+/rTorment/black mark), {augmentation} (+slay/spellpower scaling with HP), ice (rC+, freezing cloud immunity, passive freeze), fire (rF+, flame cloud immunity, hellfire). Ice/fire facets are incompatible, as are foul stench/ignite blood. / If you are monstrous (1 in 10 chance), then you get 3 body-slot facets but you don't get scales. You still get 2 tier 2 facets and 1 tier 3
13:49 < OCTOTROG> facet, for 6 facets total. Your first body slot mutation will come with the message, "You feel monstrous as your demonic heritage exerts itself."

13:50 < odiv> ??black mark
13:50 < OCTOTROG> black mark[1/2]: Demonspawn mutation gained at level 3 of the negative energy facet. Gives melee attacks that deal damage a 1/5 chance of applying antimagic, weakness or draining to the target. 
13:50 < odiv> ooh
13:50 < odiv> ??black mark[2
13:50 < OCTOTROG> black mark[2/2]: Also a monster spell, from {black sun}s and {Murray}. Any allies in LOS as well as the caster begin absorbing vital energies, and any melee done will, with no rN check, heal said individuals as well as either drain XP, speed, or mp. (This has an antimagic, slowing, or HD drain effect on other monsters). Not that dangerous without the right ally.

16:40 < OCTOTROG> majin-bo[1/3]: +6 Majin-Bo {vamp, Archmagi, MP+6 Int+6}. It's a quarterstaff! Acts as a universal spell enhancer, but costs HP every time you cast a spell: 1 HP per MP spent. (This will never kill you, directly.)

17:03 < odiv> ??rtorment
17:03 < OCTOTROG> torment resistance[1/1]: Each level of rN reduces torment's damage by 10%, so at rN+++ you'll only lose 35% of your HP. In addition, demonspawn can get a torment resistance mutation (50% chance of 0 damage), Kiku gives torment resistance (average protection 60%) at high piety, and Statue Form or being a gargoyle reduces torment damage by half.

17:59 < odiv> two lost souls showed up
18:07 < zackoid> that sounds like a bug
18:07 < zackoid> ??lost soul
18:07 < OCTOTROG> lost soul[1/2]: A crypt monster which tries to stay away from you. If a non-zombie undead dies in its LOS, the lost soul will die instead (fully healing the undead). If a living creature dies, it will become a undead (unrevivable) version of that creature. If other enemies are around, will sometimes ignore the death of low HD creatures.

20:57 < odiv> ah
20:57 < odiv> this is regen, I think, right?
21:02 < zackoid> that makes sense.
21:08 < odiv> anyway, that amulet is awesome

23:23 < odiv> ???shatter
23:23 < OCTOTROG> Level 9 earth spell. Extremely powerful attack which does damage comparable to LCS to all non-flying non-amorphous monsters in LOS radius. Doesn't damage stuff on the other side of walls, but conveniently destroys nearby walls (and potions in 0.13 and earlier) anyway. Prior to 0.15, had a range of (3 + Earth/5). / Deals 1/3x damage to flying and amorphous monsters. 2x damage to
23:23 < OCTOTROG> petrifying, skeletal and brittle monsters (stuff that can be LRD'd, mostly), and 1.5x damage  icy monsters. 4x damage to petrified! Note that it doesn't damage insubstantial monsters at all! Also, petrifying has 2/3 and petrified has 1/2 final damage reduction, so it's more like 4/3x / 2x with AC reduction. / !lg ElderVIII xl=27 pan drcj 1 -tv / !lg xuaxua xl=27 grgl place=pan 1

23:25 < odiv> Yeah, just picked it up
23:25 < odiv> bolt is in a book somewhere.
23:25 < odiv> several places
23:26 < zackoid> i think it is possible that every single blaster that i got the slimy rune with had tornado
23:26 < odiv> heh
23:26 < zackoid> which just eats up TRJ and all his summons
23:26 < zackoid> shatterninja?
23:26 < odiv> Yeah, I'm considering it, but it'd take a while.
23:26 < odiv> I'd mostly be going there for loot, so eh
23:26 < odiv> Not that I really need anything specific.
23:27 < zackoid> this guy got it without tornado: http://crawl.berotato.org/crawl/morgue//zackoid/morgue-zackoid-20160105-030928.txt
23:27 < zackoid> had pretty good melee though.  i don't remember but based on the spell list probably OOD then tele when TRJ bit it
23:27 < odiv> Nice AC!
23:28 < zackoid> gargoyles are like that.
23:28 < odiv> Yeah.
23:28 < odiv> I'll just come back later or never.

23:28 < odiv> er 4
23:28 < zackoid> if you had a penetrating spell i think 2 LCS and then something to penetrate on the retreat would work
23:29 < odiv> I suppose I could do abyss
23:29 < odiv> I should train some stealth
23:29 < odiv> I have magma
23:29 < zackoid> does that penetrate like fire/cold?
23:29 < odiv> it does have shit AC
23:29 < odiv> yep
23:29 < odiv> it's just less resistable for rF+ dudes
23:29 < odiv> and less damage/range
23:30 < zackoid> for some reason i thought it dropped off faster
23:30 < zackoid> ??bolt of magma
23:30 < OCTOTROG> bolt of magma[1/2]: 55% resistible (by rF) L5 Conj/Fire/Earth bolt spell. Range 5. To-hit: 8+power/25.
23:30 < zackoid> ??bolt of magma[2
23:30 < OCTOTROG> bolt of magma[2/2]: Most likely does more damage than force lance.
23:30 < zackoid> haha
23:31 < odiv> ???bolt of fire
23:31 < OCTOTROG> A level 6 conj/fire penetrating beam attack that can hit multiple opponents in a line for pure fire damage. Does six dice with a maximum of (18 + (power * 2) / 3). At power 50 it does 6d8 damage; at power 100 it does 6d14. As with any fire-based beams, produces steam if it passes over water. To-hit: 10+power/25.

23:31 < odiv> but I have 0 skills in ice. :P

23:32 < odiv> I thought I had a bunch, but that was my last character.

23:36 < odiv> not carts
23:36 < zackoid> iirc i found a staff of power on D:2
23:36 < odiv> nice
23:36 < zackoid> i think the xl25+ magic darts were just to pull stuff
23:36 < odiv> energy is only making a couple things hungerless for me now
23:36 < zackoid> since it's max range, and without vehumet not many spells are
23:36 < odiv> Maybe I should go pick up power again.
23:36 < odiv> or keep my AC dtrident equipped
23:36 < zackoid> power is swappable now, you just lose the bonus
23:37 < odiv> magic dart + battlesphere is a pretty mana efficient way to clear stuff out sometimes.
23:37 < odiv> Yeah, I've been swapping it.
23:37 < zackoid> well not swappable but didn't it used to have some stupid mechanic?
23:37 < odiv> until I got energy.
23:37 < odiv> don't remember.
23:37 < odiv> it didn't stack well with other MP stuff I think for one

23:46 < zackoid> oh that fo.

23:50 < OCTOTROG> A cat race that can't use armour, weapons, rods, or throw anything. They gain {extra lives} as they level up. They have claws (lvl 1: +2 dam), fangs, and fur.

12:43 < odiv> it sucks when it misses.

12:51 < odiv> I think I like earth better as a support school.

14:30 < odiv> haha
14:30 < odiv> oh god
14:30 < odiv> that would be funny
14:30 < odiv> hexes and xbows maybe
14:30 < odiv> so am wouldn't be terrible.
14:31 < odiv> well here goes nothing
14:31 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L1 FoAM) began the quest for the Orb. (D:1) [cbro+]
14:36 < zackoid> warper does have apportation and portal projectile and passage of golubria which are all pretty good for Fo
14:36 < odiv> Yeah, true. but it's a challenging start even with blink imo
14:37 < zackoid> yeah it's a bad start.
14:37 < odiv> hm
14:37 < odiv> I should have planned this
14:37 < odiv> just go all str all the way? :)
14:38 < odiv> I don't think I'm going to be much of a caster and heavy armour + big fuckoff axe + shield sounds pretty good to me.
14:38 < odiv> thoughts?
14:48 < odiv> Oops, that ring feels deathly cold.
14:48 < odiv> _o - a cursed ring of teleportation (left hand)

15:30 < odiv> chei!
15:30 < odiv> Identified the +10 great mace of the Madman {crush, *Rage rElec rC+++ Int-2} (You found it on level 4 of the Dungeon)
15:30 < odiv> holy fuck
15:31 < odiv> Yeah, that certainly sets the tone
15:36 < zackoid> i did a lot of fo of chei in linesprint.
15:36 < zackoid> it's fun but obviously not very good for winning a particular game.
15:36 < zackoid> better stop training axes!
15:37 < odiv> hm?
15:37 < odiv> why is that?
15:37 < odiv> oh, yeah, that's not me.
15:37 < zackoid> oh right.
15:37 < odiv> that's from the log above.
15:37 < odiv> I wish
15:37 < odiv> was still using it at the end
15:38 < zackoid> does stasis prevent *rage?
15:39 < odiv> stasis itself did
15:39 < odiv> is fo stasis exactly stasis?
15:39 < odiv> ??stasis
15:40 < OCTOTROG> stasis[1/1]: Blocks teleport, blink, haste, slow, berserk, and paralysis. The amulet (removed in 0.18) will give you some (possibly yellow) {contam} and cancel the status if you put it on while hasted or slowed, or while waiting for teleport. Formicids have this as an intrinsic.
15:40 < odiv> Yeah, awesome
15:40 < odiv> ha
16:57 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L6 FoAM) entered the Ecumenical Temple. (D:4) [cbro+]
16:58 < odiv> oh right
16:58 < odiv> what god?
16:58 < odiv> zackoid: ping
16:58 < odiv> makhleb seems like a bad choice because tele is important when summoning angry demons
16:59 < odiv> !lg * won FoAM s=god
16:59 < OCTOTROG> 29 games for * (won FoAM): 6x Okawaru, 3x Ashenzari, 3x Gozag, 3x Cheibriados, 2x Fedhas, 2x Makhleb, 2x Ru, 2x Xom, Yredelemnul, The Shining One, Trog, Zin, Nemelex Xobeh, Hepliaklqana
16:59 < odiv> gozag?
16:59 < odiv> ???gozag
16:59 < OCTOTROG> The greedy god of gold. Turns corpses into gold, which gives a distraction status that may cause enemies to lose turns. Lets you use {potion petition}, lets you {call merchant}s, and lets you {bribe branch}es. Does not have a normal piety system. / Joining Gozag costs some gold, based on the amount of gold generated in the game so far. On conversion all abilities are available, as long
16:59 < OCTOTROG> as you have enough gold.  / https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:brainstorm:god:propose:gold / <kroki> actually i wanted to try out the money god <kroki> its shit and boring af <kroki> some dev must really love the god /  <Karasu_> So I guess I have to abandon Gozag or else I'll starve / <mibe> you should be able to cancel [potion petition] by abandoning your religion from
16:59 < odiv> I do need a gozag win
16:59 < OCTOTROG> that screen / <Stendarr> b - [D:5] the cursed +0 robe of Gozag's Brutal Revenge {rC+} (163 gold) <Stendarr> so brutal
17:01 < odiv> ???potion petition
17:01 < OCTOTROG> Lets you buy one of three random lists of potion effects, with price depending on the potions offered. The lists can include most good tactical potions. The price of potions does not increase with each use.
17:01 < odiv> ???call merchant
17:01 < OCTOTROG> Pick a shop from a list of four randomly chosen types, and place the shop at your current location. The merchants never ask for more gold than activating call merchant requires, usually significantly less. The quality of the shop contents is based on your XL. / In 0.17-, the shop is placed in an unexplored D/V:1-4/U floor with no previous shops, and the quality of the shop contents is
17:01 < OCTOTROG> better on deeper levels. You get a message when you enter the floor with the shop and you can also check their location on ctrl-o.
17:01 < zackoid> i think they made finesse work on formicids now?
17:02 < odiv> yeah, I think so.
17:02 < odiv> ???finesse
17:02 < OCTOTROG> Heroism (*) temporarily gives +5 to all non-magic skills except Invocations and Evocations, although Fighting skill from it gives no extra HP. Finesse (*****) halves attack delay but does not stack with haste or berserk. Okawaru also gifts weapons, armour, and ammo.
17:02 < zackoid> * Finesse is no longer blocked by stasis.
17:02 < zackoid> is 0.18

17:02 < OCTOTROG> Unwon gods for odiv: Elyvilon, Fedhas, Gozag, Hepliaklqana, Qazlal, Sif Muna, Ukayaw, Uskayaw, Xom, Yredelemnul, Zin
17:03 < zackoid> yred would help with escapes.
17:03 < odiv> hm
17:03 < odiv> I'd probably want to switch to a bardiche
17:04 < zackoid> i've only done gozag with Mu--.  as long as you don't rely on spells that's probably fine too
17:04 < zackoid> hepl was considered really strong but comes with frail 1 now
17:05 < zackoid> i've only done oka and lugonu with fo
17:06 < odiv> I'm on stable, so no hepl
17:06 < odiv> on the plus side, there's pak. :)
17:06 < zackoid> qaz would probably be a bad idea.
17:07 < zackoid> pak was great, but if you're already investing in crossbows not as much
17:07 < odiv> I have like 4 in xbows

17:09 < odiv> shoot xbows past plants
17:09 < odiv> summon shit to run away
17:09 < zackoid> fedhas is strong
17:09 < zackoid> and annoying imo.
17:10 < odiv> fedhas is decent for 3 runes I think
17:10 < zackoid> considered the best early game god iirc
17:11 < odiv> and I do need fedhas for poly
17:11 < odiv> well, we'll see if he's in this temple
17:12 < odiv> nope
17:12 < odiv> no even oka or gozag

17:20 < zackoid> heh vehumet sticks out a lot
17:20 < odiv> How?
17:20 < zackoid> well you can eliminate TSO and jiyva for being late gods.  pakellas and ru have a recency bias.
17:20 < zackoid> no idea what is up with beogh
17:21 < zackoid> maybe just small sample

17:22 < odiv> since my last two were vehumet and trog?

17:23 < odiv> oh, there it is
17:23 < odiv> next to beogh
17:24 < odiv> it's just not letting me mouse over.
17:24 < zackoid> i thought you had a Dg win?
17:24 < odiv> yeah, it's there next to Beogh
17:25 < odiv> it's just a really low % because I have so many games played where I didn't last long enough for a god.
17:26 < zackoid> 0.12%
17:32 < odiv> yes, I realize I die a lot. :(
17:32 < zackoid> everyone does without a god

18:15 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.

18:58 < odiv> Yeah, I don't think enchant gets rid of cursed anymore?
18:58 < odiv> so that ring and dire flail look pretty good right?
18:58 < odiv> That seems like an endgame quality weapon.
18:59 < odiv> ??great mace
18:59 < OCTOTROG> great mace[1/1]: (maces & flails; -4 acc / 17 dam / 1.7 base delay / 0.7 min delay; two handed). An enormous metal war club, of great cumbrousness. The largest mace most playable races can wield. Ogres and Trolls can wield giant (spiked) clubs too.

18:59 < OCTOTROG> dire flail[1/1]: (maces & flails; -3 acc / 13 dam / 1.3 base delay / 0.6 min delay; two handed). A flail with long spikes and a heavier head.

After 40-50 turns, the passage will disappear (making a snapping noise in the process) so be careful if you were relying on it for escape.

10:36 < OCTOTROG> One game for zackoid (cikiller=the_player_character): a kobold (exploding inner flame (29))
14:17 < odiv> the +12 war axe "Waoss" {chop, MR++}
14:20 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L15 FoAM) killed the ghost of mandarbmax the Brawler, a journeyman TrMo of Ru. (D:13) [cbro+]

14:23 < zackoid> odiv: how is foaming?
14:24 < odiv> too easy right now
14:26  * zackoid knocks on wood.
14:28 < zackoid> i wonder if you should use slings instead of crossbows
14:28 < zackoid> actually i'm pretty sure you should, other than greatslings are 1H.
15:08 < odiv> you think?
15:08 < odiv> seems like a waste, but yeah probably right
15:08 < odiv> I'm just waiting for penetration. Is that still a thing?
15:18 < zackoid> odiv: uh not sure, lots of branded ammo got removed
15:18 < zackoid> since you haven't trained much crossbows and you a great greatsling it probably makes sense to use that
15:18 < zackoid> though it'll still be pretty good untrained i'd guess
15:20 < zackoid> ??penetration brand
15:20 < OCTOTROG> I don't have a page labeled penetration_brand in my learndb.
15:24 < odiv> ??penetration
15:24 < OCTOTROG> penetration[1/1]: Missiles fired from a launcher of penetration act like bolt spells and can hit several targets. Not unique to crossbows anymore, as javelins may have this brand as well. Also on {piercer} in 0.14+.
15:24 < odiv> Yeah, it's on the launcher now.
15:25 < odiv> and I've got my +12 fuckin' axe

15:25 < odiv> ran across a topor snail and it didn't slow me down.

15:26 < odiv> getting greatsling up a bit wouldn't really hurt anyway
15:26 < zackoid> i think holding out for a penetration crossbow is probably not likely to pay off
15:26 < odiv> yeah, you're right.
15:26 < zackoid> i have no idea what the probabilites are with oka but they can't be big
15:59 < odiv> seems like I always find one
15:59 < odiv> but maybe way later than would be useful.
16:00 < zackoid> i can't recall the last time i even saw one, but i don't use xbows that much
16:02 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L15 FoAM) killed Gastronok. (Lair:3) [cbro+]
16:05 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Maud. (Lair:6) [cbro+]
16:10 < odiv> +8 arbalest as gift, ooh
16:10 < odiv> but I'm already using punk
16:16 < zackoid> heh sorry
16:17 < odiv> nah, that's not amazing
16:17 < odiv> triple arbalest of penetration would be where it's at.
16:17 < zackoid> i never use triple xbows because 26 skill is nutso
16:20 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) became the Champion of Okawaru. (Lair:8) [cbro+]
16:21 < odiv> such a perfectionist.
17:53 < odiv> 491 gold   the ring "Ryson" {Fragile +Fly rPois Dex+7}
17:53 < odiv> I wonder if I should get that.
17:53 < odiv> probably not
17:56 < zackoid> why not?  do you have a better use for money and/or ring slots currently?
17:57 < zackoid> for 500g i would wear that through lair branches easily
17:57 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Harold. (Orc:1) [cbro+]

18:05 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L16 FoAM) killed Nergalle. (Orc:2) [cbro+]
18:07 < odiv> and that's orc done
18:09 < odiv> You finish putting on the +1 pair of gloves of Raukkecuwn {rPois Dex+4}
18:10 < zackoid> especially since you're training dodging too, 7 dex is probably wroth a couple EV with such a low base dex
18:12 < odiv> what str do I need for cpa or ice dragon armour?
18:13 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L17 FoAM) killed Urug. (D:14) [cbro+]
18:13 < zackoid> do you mean or gold dragon armour?
18:14 < zackoid> i think CPA is 25ish.  IDA is only like 12ish
18:14 < odiv> oh cool
18:14 < zackoid> i don't think i've ever actually worn CPA outside of sprint
18:14 < zackoid> ??cpa
18:14 < OCTOTROG> crystal plate armour[1/2]: 14AC, 23ER.
18:15 < odiv> k, thanks
18:15 < zackoid> is the trident for hydras?
18:15 < odiv> I guess I'll start going into dex
18:15 < odiv> Yeah it was
18:15 < zackoid> yeah i never take str once i'm into the low 20's.  though with the changes to strweight there might be benefits, not sure
18:16 < zackoid> i probably put too much importance on balancing AC and EV though
18:16 < OCTOTROG> odiv (L17 FoAM) reached level 15 of the Dungeon. (D:15) [cbro+]
18:16 < odiv> you cannot shaft yourself on this level.

11:24 < zackoid> odiv: tengus are like the most vehumet species possible
11:24 < odiv> I got conj,fire, and ice books

11:25 < zackoid> i'm suprised you haven't won one before because of that
11:25 < odiv> probably go air/fire
11:26 < odiv> I kinda want to start streaming crawl.
11:26 < odiv> I should get better first.
11:26 < odiv> and I would either have to play tiles or just have another window open with tiles that I stream. :P
11:26 < zackoid> i never understand streaming crawl because it's pretty bad for that
11:26 < odiv> is it?
11:26 < zackoid> since you have built in streaming and recording but when you use video it's hard to display in a way that is readable
11:27 < odiv> I guess people can just tune in on the web, yeah.
11:27 < odiv> I wonder if anyone ever tries to chat with me.
11:27 < zackoid> if you are going to video cast you should set up a tiles profile specifically for it and spectate your own games, then stream the spectate
11:27 < zackoid> gammafunk has an rc for it, with bigger font and tiles 
11:27 < odiv> ah
11:28 < zackoid> it's weird that they still haven't made it so tileschat is relayed to the console player
11:34 < odiv> I rember reading it in my log after I'd finished a while ago.
11:34 < odiv> but they don't put it in there any more.
11:35 < zackoid> it's an option

11:47 <@shmup> kinda just stream to stream cause your audience is gonna suck anyways
11:47 < odiv> Oh no, I don't think there's an audience for this.
11:47 <@shmup> yeah
11:47 <@shmup> will you talk to streamers?

09:55 <@shmup> wait I am not thinking clearly..
09:55 <@shmup> shorest win is least # of turns
09:55 <@shmup> fastest win is.. least amount of time?
09:55 <@shmup> isn't time directly a function of turns though?
09:55 <@shmup> in this context
09:56 < zackoid> since they have both fastest and shortest i assume that fastest means purely real time
09:56 < zackoid> and time and turncount aren't really related, no
